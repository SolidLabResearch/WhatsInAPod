      <h2 property="schema:name">Abstract</h2>
      <!-- Context      -->
      <p>The Solid vision aims to make data independent of applications
through technical specifications,
which detail how to publish and consume permissioned data
across multiple autonomous locations called <q>pods</q>.
<!-- Need         -->
This envisaged independence is not fully realized
by the current document-centric interpretation
wherein a pod is solely a hierarchy of Linked Data documents,
leading to fundamental interoperability and query problems.
Furthermore,
the broader longterm vision for Solid is confounded
with the concrete HTTP interface to pods today,
leading to a narrower solution space for these problems.
<!-- Task         -->
We examined the mismatch between the vision
and the prevalent document-centric interpretation,
and propose a graph-centric interpretation
wherein a pod is fundamentally a knowledge graph.
<!-- Object       -->
In this article,
we contrast the existing and proposed interpretations
in terms of how they realize the Solid vision.
We argue that the knowledge-centric interpretation
improves pod access through different Web APIs
that act as views in a database sense.
<!-- Findings     -->
We show that our zoomed-out interpretation
provides improved opportunities for
storage, publication, and querying of decentralized data
in more flexible and sustainable ways.
<!-- Conclusion   -->
These insights are crucial to reduce
the dependency of Solid apps on implicit API semantics
and local assumptions about the shape and organization of data
and the resulting performance.
<!-- Perspectives -->
The suggested broader interpretation supports Solid with
its evolution into a heterogeneous yet interoperable ecosystem
that accommodates a multitude of read/write data access patterns.</p>

      <h2 property="schema:name">The Solid vision</h2>
      <!-- problem: your data being everywhere, no control very limited interoperability -->
      <p>In the current Web 2.0 ecosystem, 
data ownership and privacy have lost a lot of ground.
Data that is often user generated is stored far away in centralized data silos
and is rarely under direct user control.
In this system, the user neither has the control nor the knowledge to manage how their data is being used in the online space <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]</span>.
<!-- Solid: a vision for a better Web -->
As a response to this, the Solid project was created with the aim of revitalizing the Web <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]</span>.
Where the current system of centralized data silos create an ecosystem of limited integration, availability and innovation,
Tim Berners-Lee’s Solid brings a course correction for the Web.
<!-- ecosystem goal: control over data, interoperability over applications and data -->
Based on the separation of applications and data on the Web,
the vision defines an ecosystem that facilitates the integration of data in applications, while keeping users in direct control of their data <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]</span>.</p>

      <!-- the Solid pod -->
      <p>It introduces the concept of the personal online datastore (pod)
as an online data space for users to control and manage their data on the Web.
These pods form a decentralized Solid ecosystem,
from which applications can directly integrate data from the user Solid pod,
after receiving permission from the user.
This is in contrast to the Web 2.0 architecture where
this data first had to be collected in a centralized location,
after which the platform-specific API had to be integrated,
where all the while user control is at the mercy of the platforms maintaining the data <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]</span>.</p>

      <!-- key for achieving requirement: capture semantics in the data -->
      <p>A key premise for enabling the separation of application and data
is the capture of semantic information in the data itself.
This way, applications can interpret the data without 
requiring specific knowledge encoded in the API over which the data is retrieved. A key driver here is the use of the Resource Description Framework (RDF) <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-3">3</a>]</span>, that provides an infrastructure that enables the capture of this semantic information in the data.
This again stands in contrast to the current Web 2.0 architecture,
where data is often served in formats that require additional semantics to be captured in the documentation of the API.
In this way, the Solid ecosystem marks a transition
from a Web ecosystem of API integration towards
a Web ecosystem centered around data integration <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-4">4</a>]</span>.</p>

      <!-- Now this vision has to be made a reality -->
      <p>From the vision of this ecosystem, 
the challenge now presents itself in how these concepts
can be captured in specifications for the Web.
<!-- The vision is room for many interpretations -->
The proposed vision is is based on broad concepts of interoperability
and user control, so the realization of these concepts can take many different forms.
<!-- there is no authoritative definition -->
As there is no authoritative definition currently available for Solid,
the current initiatives and specifications defining the ecosystem are based on specific interpretations of the Solid vision, and how this can be translated into specifications for the Web.</p>

      <p>In <a href="#documentcentric">Section 2</a>, we describe the interpretation of the Solid vision as a document-centric ecosystem, which is the understanding on which most of the Solid ecosystem is based.
In response to the limitations of this interpretation, 
we present a zoomed-out perspective of a graph-centric interpretation of the Solid ecosystem in <a href="#graphcentric">Section 3</a>.
We describe how this perspective creates a broader base for innovation,
by expanding upon the current state of the ecosystem.
Finally, we present our conclusions in <a href="#conclusion">Section 4</a>.</p>

  <section id="documentcentric" inlist="" rel="schema:hasPart" resource="#documentcentric">
<div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
      <h2 property="schema:name">The Solid pod as a permissioned document hierarchy</h2>
      <!-- The first interpretation we look at is document-centric. -->
      <p>The envisioned Solid ecosystem in its current state is not well defined, 
and leaves room for different interpretations of the concepts proposed in the vision.
In this section, we present the currently frequently shared understanding of Solid
as a document-centric ecosystem, where the Solid pod is fundamentally understood
as a permissioned document hierarchy.</p>

      <!-- data and files stored as documents on the pod -->
      <p>In this interpretation of the ecosystem,
the premise of separation of application and data is approached 
from the perspective of the Solid pods as a document storage system.
The Solid pod manages all data as documents in a hierarchical structure 
of documents and containers, similar to a file system organizes data
as files ad directories.
Structured data can be stored on the Solid pod by 
converting it to a document in an RDF format,
and storing this document on the Solid pod.
Similarly, other non-RDF documents can be stored in the 
Solid pod document hierarchy.
These documents are then exposed over the Web by the Solid pod.
In this way, the ecosystem achieves the separation of application and data
by storing the application data as (non-)RDF documents on the Solid pod.
User control is maintained on the document level through the management of permissions.
This interpretation of the Solid pod as fundamentally a document hierarchy is
further supported in the concept of <em>slash semantics</em> in the current version of the Solid protocol <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-5">5</a>]</span>,
where the hierarchical relationships between documents and their parent container are defined
through the slash (/) characters in their URIs.</p>

      <!-- read/write interface  -->
      <p>The enable users and applications to create and interact with documents stored on the Solid pod,
an adaptation of the Linked Data Platform (LDP) specification <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-6">6</a>]</span> was introduced.
This LDP interface represents the authoritative organization of documents on the Solid pod as a
hierarchical organization of resources (documents) and containers.
Apart from the restriction of representing data as documents, 
and organizing these documents in a hierarchical structure,
the interface has no restrictions on the ways 
applications and users can structure their data over the interface
as documents on the pod.</p>

      <!--  The authorization interface -->
      <p>Similarly, the current authorization mechanisms for the Solid pod are based on the document structure of the pod.
There are currently two specifications that are being used to manage authorization in the Solid ecosystem:
the Web Access Controls specification (WAC) <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-7">7</a>]</span> and the Access Control Policy (ACP) <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-8">8</a>]</span> specification.
Where both specifications differ in their handling of permissions,
both work on top of the notion of the Solid pod being a document hierarchy,
where the granularity through which data sharing can be managed
is limited by the granularity of the documents storing this data on the Solid pod.
As these documents can be managed by applications, 
the applications can indirectly control the granularity of permissions on the user data pod.</p>

      <h3 id="application-interoperability-in-the-document-centric-ecosystem">Application interoperability in the document-centric ecosystem</h3>
      <!-- Interoperability problems -->
      <p>With the current Solid ecosystem delivering the specifications as is, 
developers are left with many degrees of freedom in their interpretation 
of the ecosystem and how they can support it in their applications.
Where concepts of interoperability and user control are central in the Solid vision,
in their implementation in the current specifications they are very dependent
on how applications decide to integrate them.
Where the LDP interface of a Solid pod enables some forms of interoperability,
it also allows the application to use the Solid pod as a remote document management system.
Similarly, the authorization interfaces enable users to manage the permissions 
of the documents on their Solid pod, they are limited by how applications
decide to structure their data as documents on the user pod.</p>

      <!-- This proposes Solid as a document-centric ecosystem. -->
      <p>In a practical example, we examine two applications that manage contact information,
and write their data to the user Solid pod.
<!-- hierarchy mismatch -->
Both applications may make totally different assumptions of how they structure their contact data in documents,
and where they store these documents in the pod document hierarchy.
Because of this, both applications may not know other contact information is available on the pod,
or even if they scout the Solid pod for additional data, the structuring of the other contact information
may be different in structure to a point that it has become unreadable for the other application 
that holds the assumption that contact data should be structured differently.
<!-- writing same location -->
In case both applications want to forcibly write to the same location,
e.g. a container <code>/contacts/</code> on the pod, 
they can create problems with overwriting data, 
or may just create extra documents in this container
that follow different rules to data structuring,
creating issues or even crashing other applications that hold specific assumptions 
to the structuring of data on the Solid pod.
<!-- permission management -->
Additionally, the management of permissions is also indirectly connected to the applications writing data to the Solid pod.
As authorization systems are tied to the document hierarchy of the Solid pod,
the sharing of this data is limited to the created document structure by applications.
As one application might split its contact information in different documents, 
creating a more granular system for sharing parts of contact information,
the other application might assume the whole contact to be a single document on the pod.
This creates issues where one application given access to data by another application leads to 
a mismatch in data sharing, as either not enough data is shared, as the assumption that all data for a contact
should be contained in a single resource does not hold,
or inversely it creates the situation where an app that only requests the name and WebID values for your contacts
now must get access to either all or none of the available information on these contacts, 
as contacts are stored as a single document containing all information on that contact.
This mismatch in the granularity of data, combined with the assumptions of applications in the generation of these data documents,
leads to problems in the sharing of data, and limits the control users can exercise on this data.</p>

      <p>The above described ecosystem, defined by the interpretation of Solid as a document-centric ecosystem,
invites problems in interoperability between applications,
as data granularity is limited to documents generated by assumptions in application logic,
and the hierarchical organization of these documents on the Solid pod invite assumptions
to the structuring of data on the Solid pod.
It provides an innovation surface that is limited by the capabilities of the document-centric 
interpretation and design for the ecosystem and the interfaces exposed by the Solid pods.</p>

      <h3 id="a-distilled-knowledge-graph-representation">A distilled knowledge graph representation</h3>
      <!-- The document-centric vision as a KG -->
      <p>To improve upon these problems, 
we clearly see initiatives trying to reconcile the 
document-centric nature of the ecosystem with the perspective
of treating the data stored in these documents as a Knowledge Graph.
Back in the early iterations of the Solid protocol,
the shortcomings of the LDP interface in terms of 
querying were already mentioned. Originally these proposed
the inclusion of extensions to the used LDP specification,
as well as an optional SPARQL interface for the Solid pod 
to resolve these issues <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]</span>.
This perspective of the Solid pod document hierarchy as a 
Knowledge Graph solves a lot of issues in terms of interoperability,
as the organization of data in the document hierarchy does not matter
for the knowledge graph distilled from these documents enables
applications to work directly on the data itself without 
requiring any assumptions of the data organization in the document
hierarchy of the Solid pod.
The provision of an endpoint is also not a core requirement, 
as this distillation process can happen fully on the client side.
Recently, the Enterprise Solid Server implementation by Inrupt 
provided another implementation of this concept
by including an optional QPF-endpoint interface 
for the Solid pods hosted over their server implementation. <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-9">9</a>]</span>.</p>

      <!-- Still has problems -->
      <p>However, even with this perspective on the Solid pod, 
where the document organization of the data in the Solid pod is ignored,
we still run into limitations caused by the document hierarchy of the Solid pod.
Where the problem of the data organization is mitigated, 
as other applications are free to ignore this perspective,
the incentive to add semantic enrichment to written data is low.
The distillation process is also dependent on client interpretation
as to how to build the knowledge graph on top of the exposed LDP interface,
where applications may want to rely on information only available
over the LDP interface such as resource timestamps
As this perspective only uses the knowledge graph 
in a query context, writing data to the pod still requires
the wrapping of this data in arbitrary document structures,
and may incur problems for other applications when writing to common
containers or documents.
And finally, the management of permissions is still
tied to the document hierarchy of the Solid pod, and cannot be
defined in terms of the individual statements in the data.</p>

      <p>The current innovation surface for the Solid ecosystem is far from reached.
Both through innovations steered by the solid community such as application interoperability <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-10">10</a>]</span>,
as well as through external research such as 
GDPR compliance of the authorization mechanisms <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-11">11</a>]</span>,
new innovations and industry attention create a rapidly evolving ecosystem.
However, in the current document-centric ecosystem,
these innovations are constrained by the document hierarchy of the Solid pods they operate on,
and may fall short of their inherent potential.
Because of this, we feel that a shift in perspective is necessary 
for the Solid ecosystem to evolve in a way that promotes longevity 
in their solutions, and a way that maximizes the innovations 
we can build on the ecosystem.</p>

<div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
      <h2 property="schema:name">The Solid pod as a permissioned Knowledge Graph</h2>
      <p>In the previous section, we outlined the current interpretation 
of Solid as a document-centric ecosystem, where the Solid pod takes the role 
of a permissioned document hierarchy. We demonstrated that even when querying
the Solid pod as a Knowledge graph, interoperability in the ecosystem is still
constrained by its document-centric interpretation.</p>

      <p>This leads us to conclude, 
that where document sharing as a basis provides a limited innovation surface,
the goal of the ecosystem is to achieve the sharing of data,
which should not be limited by any single document hierarchy.</p>

      <p>This leads us to propose the definition of the Solid pod as <em>fundamentally being a permissioned, hybrid knowledge graph, exposed through Web APIs</em>.
<!-- permissioned -->
With the term <em>permissioned</em>, we express the ability to manage permissions over any individual nodes and relation in the knowledge graph.
Note that we use this term to lean close to the current proposition for user control in Solid, 
but that we recognize the term <em>parameterized</em> as a potential evolution, where next to only user permissions,
any number of parameters can be retained for the individual nodes and relations in the knowledge graph. 
<!-- hybdid -->
The term <em>hybrid</em> expresses the ability of the knowledge graph to store any kind of data as nodes in the knowledge graph 
in the form of blobs, for which metadata can be maintained in the knowledge graph.
<!-- knowledge grap -->
For the term <em>knowledge graph</em>, 
we adopt the definition proposed by <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-12">12</a>]</span>:
“<em>Herein we adopt an inclusive definition, 
where we view a knowledge graph as a graph of data intended to accumulate and convey knowledge of the real world,
whose nodes represent entities of interest and whose edges represent relations between these entities. 
The graph of data (aka data graph) conforms to a graph-based data model, 
which may be a directed edge-labelled graph, a property graph, etc.</em>”
<!-- Web APIs -->
And finally, the definition states that this knowledge graph can be exposed using any suitable Web API,
so that we do not constrain the possibilities of the ecosystem to the capabilities of any specific API.</p>

      <h3 id="a-fundamentally-different-interpretation">A fundamentally different interpretation</h3>
      <!-- The interpretation -->
      <p>With the proposed definition, we want to provide a zoomed-out perspective on the current state of the Solid ecosystem.
Where in the current ecosystem, the document hierarchy of a Solid pod is constraining factor,
it can instead be perceived as one of the many possible interfaces
that can be constructed over the internal knowledge graph of the Solid pod.
In this new interpretation of the ecosystem, the document hierarchy then no longer defines the 
authoritative source for the ordering of data on the Solid pod,
but can be used to represent any number of hierarchies over the data in the knowledge graph of the Solid pod,
based on the requirements and assumption of applications interacting with the Solid pod.
In this ecosystem, the innovation surface is no longer constrained by a single 
document hierarchy that forms the authoritative source for the data on the Solid pod, 
but by a knowledge graph that can be exposed over any suitable API and over which you can construct any number of document hierarchies.</p>

      <!-- The current Solid protocol as a KG -->
      <p>Note that this interpretation of the ecosystem 
does not invalidate the current Solid protocol.
It however changes the implication of the exposed LDP interface of the Solid pod
from the authoritative source of data, 
to an interface over the internal knowledge graph of pod.
Where in the current ecosystem 
permissions are defined based on the document hierarchy of the LDP interface,
in the zoomed-out perspective,
the document hierarchy of the LDP interface 
is based on the permissions of the data in the knowledge graph.
By generating the documents over the internal knowledge graph, 
the interface can only include data for which adequate permissions are given.
In this way, the current protocols are reused,
but their position in the ecosystem is updated to better reflect their function 
as interfaces for the data on the Solid pod.</p>

      <p>Similarly, the current authorization protocols in their current state can be reused
to set permissions for the subset of data in a document for which this is allowed,
as they cannot be used to manage permissions for single data entries in a document.</p>

      <!-- comparison -->

      <!-- conclusion -->
      <p>The optional SPARQL interface <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]</span> included in the first versions of the Solid protocol,
as well as the current Inrupt pod implementation of an optional QPF-interface <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-9">9</a>]</span>,
shows a clear sign towards a knowledge-graph interpretation of the Solid pod, at least from a query perspective.
Through this zoomed-out perspective of the Solid pod being fundamentally a knowledge graph,
we see that these innovations are attempts to provide the proposed solution space
within the confines of the document hierarchy of the Solid pods.
Where they are viewed as optional additions to the LDP interface in the current ecosystem,
we propose to view these protocols as equal in their function to provide an interface
over the knowledge graph of the Solid pod.</p>

      <!-- Reflection on the current ecosystem -->
      <p>In the current Solid ecosystem,
the common interpretation of the ecosystem has moved towards a document-centric vision,
where the Linked Data Platform interface is central to the notion of what constitutes a Solid pod.
It creates a limited space for innovation,
by constraining the interoperability and user control of data
to the document hierarchy on the Solid pod.</p>

      <!-- With this work, we propose perspective of Solid as ...  -->
      <p>With this work, we proposed the interpretation of the Solid pod 
being fundamentally a permissioned, hybrid knowledge graph, 
exposed through Web APIs.</p>

      <!-- what does it do -->
      <p>Through this zoomed-out perspective of the ecosystem
we define an innovation space that is not constrained 
by specific protocols, but that can build upon the current 
protocols to provide more general solutions for the 
challenges faced by the ecosystem.</p>

      <!-- how does it build -->
      <p>By reframing the current protocols for managing data (LDP) 
and authorization (WAC/ACP) into interfaces exposing an 
internal knowledge graph of the Solid pod,
we can re-use these protocols in a new setting.
By shifting the understanding from a data graph 
created over a document system,
towards a document system,
dynamically created over a data graph,
we can fundamentally shift the understanding of the ecosystem
towards a graph-centric interpretation.</p>

      <p>Though we do not propose any specific takeaway as to which interfaces 
may be better suited to provide solutions in the current ecosystem,
we invite the reader to think along in how this zoomed-out perspective of the ecosystem
can lead to better solutions to the problems faced by the ecosystem today.</p>

      <p><br />
What’s in a pod? <em>It’s in the eye of the beholder</em>, not in the constraints of an interface.</p>
