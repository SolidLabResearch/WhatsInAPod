      <!-- Context      -->
      <p>The Solid vision aims to make data independent of applications
through technical specifications,
which detail how to publish and consume permissioned data
across multiple autonomous locations called <q>pods</q>.
<!-- Need         -->
This envisaged independence is not fully realized
by the current document-centric interpretation
wherein a pod is solely a hierarchy of Linked Data documents,
leading to fundamental interoperability and query problems.
Furthermore,
the broader longterm vision for Solid is confounded
with the concrete HTTP interface to pods today,
leading to a narrower solution space for these problems.
<!-- Task         -->
We examined the mismatch between the vision
and the prevalent document-centric interpretation,
and propose a graph-centric interpretation
wherein a pod is fundamentally a knowledge graph.
<!-- Object       -->
In this article,
we contrast the existing and proposed interpretations
in terms of how they realize the Solid vision.
We argue that the knowledge-centric interpretation
improves pod access through different Web APIs
that act as views in a database sense.
<!-- Findings     -->
We show that our zoomed-out interpretation
provides improved opportunities for
storage, publication, and querying of decentralized data
in more flexible and sustainable ways.
<!-- Conclusion   -->
These insights are crucial to reduce
the dependency of Solid apps on implicit API semantics
and local assumptions about the shape and organization of data
and the resulting performance.
<!-- Perspectives -->
The suggested broader interpretation supports Solid with
its evolution into a heterogeneous yet interoperable ecosystem
that accommodates a multitude of read/write data access patterns.</p>

        <h2 property="schema:name">The Solid vision</h2>
        <!-- problem: your data being everywhere, no control very limited interoperability -->
        <p>In the current Web 2.0 ecosystem, 
user data is often stored far away in centralized data silos,
hidden away behind the interfaces of large data platforms
and rarely under direct user control.
In this system, the user lacks both the control and the knowledge to manage their data in the online space <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]</span>.
<!-- Solid: a vision for a better Web -->
As a response to this, the Solid project was created with the aim of revitalizing the Web <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]</span>.
Where the current Web is characterized by limited integration, availability and control of data,
Tim Berners-Lee’s Solid brings a course correction for the Web.
<!-- a decentralized vision -->
It defines the vision for a decentralized ecosystem
where users are in control of their data in the online space
and centralized data platforms are replaced
by a decentralized network of smaller data sources.
<!-- enabled through data integration -->
In this ecosystem, the integration of specific APIs
provides no scalability, and the ecosystem shifts
away from API-integration, towards a more scalable
ecosystem based on data-integration <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-3">3</a>]</span>].</p>

        <!-- separation of application and data -->
        <p>In the current Web 2.0 ecosystem, applications manage data storage,
leading to centralized data silos with limited user control.
In contrast, the Solid vision is built on the notion
of the separation of applications and data on the Web.
In this vision, users can guide applications in where to 
retrieve and store their data, moving the data away
from centralized data silos into user-managed data spaces.</p>

        <!-- data under user control -->
        <p>Through this externalizing of data storage and retrieval
into user-managed space, users can be put in control
of their data in the online space.
From here, users are now free to share
their data over the Web with other applications
and users at will.</p>

        <!-- key for achieving requirement: capture semantics in the data -->
        <p>The current Web 2.0 ecosystem does not support this process.
Currently, applications are reliant on the integration of APIs to 
learn the semantics of the data returned over the API.
This leads to scaling issues when working with multiple data sources,
as this requires the application to integrate multiple APIs over which
data is retrieved.
In contrast, the Solid vision for the Web envisions applications
integrating data from large numbers of data sources,
where this limited scaling is not an option.
To enable this Solid ecosystem,
semantics must be captured outside of the API and application logic,
an in the data itself.
To enable this vision, the Resource Description 
Framework (RDF) <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-4">4</a>]</span> was introduced.
This framework provides the infrastructure required 
to capture semantics in the structuring of the data itself.</p>

        <!-- the Solid pod - user control -->
        <p>As a summation of the vision for a new Web ecosystem,
based on the concepts of separation of application and data,
user control of their data in the online space
and the encoding of semantic information in the data itself,
the concept of the Solid pod takes form.
Introduced as the personal online datastore (pod),
the pod is provides the backend over which the separation 
of application and data is achieved.
By storing user data on their personal pod,
it is in a space they can manage and control 
and from where they can share their data over the Web.
It provides support semantically enriched RDF data
to enable applications to integrate data of many pods at once.
As such, it serves as the backbone 
on which the current re-decentralization 
of the Web is built <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-5">5</a>]</span>.</p>

        <!-- Now this vision has to be made a reality -->
        <p>From this vision,
the challenge now presents itself in to capture 
these concepts as specifications for the Web.
<!-- The vision is room for many interpretations -->
As the vision is broad in its concepts,
the realization of these concepts 
is largely based on interpretation
and can take many forms.
<!-- there is no authoritative definition -->
With no authoritative definition available,
the current implementations for the ecosystem
are based on shared interpretations of the vision
that may end up being a limiting factor for future innovation.</p>

        <p>In <a href="#documentcentric">Section 2</a>, we describe the interpretation 
of the Solid as a document-centric ecosystem as currently
the central focus, and how its imposed document hierarchy limits innovation.
As a response, in <a href="#graphcentric">Section 3</a> we present a zoomed-out perspective of the ecosystem
where the Solid pod is interpreted as fundamentally being a knowledge graph.
We explore how this definition fundamentally expands upon the ecosystem
and creates a broader base for innovation.
Finally, we present our conclusions in <a href="#conclusion">Section 4</a>.</p>

  <section id="documentcentric" inlist="" rel="schema:hasPart" resource="#documentcentric">
<div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
        <h2 property="schema:name">The Solid pod as a permissioned document hierarchy</h2>
        <!-- The first interpretation we look at is document-centric. -->
        <p>The current focus of the Solid the Solid ecosystem
is based on the interpretation of the vision in
an ecosystem that is centered on the exchange of documents,
as is the case for the current Web.</p>

        <!-- The Role of the Solid pod -->
        <p>In this system, the role of the Solid pod
becomes that of a document management system.
The Solid pod becomes fundamentally 
a permissioned document hierarchy,
where user data is stored as documents
that can be managed and shared by the user.
In this way, it is similar to a remote file system
that the user and application can use to store documents.
This concept is made explicit in the Solid protocol <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-6">6</a>]</span>
though the inclusion of <em>slash semantics</em>, 
where the slash (/) characters in the URIs
of documents and containers represent their
position in the document hierarchy.</p>

        <!-- The separation of app and data -->
        <p>To enable the separation of application
and data, users and applications must be able
to store and interact with their data on their pod.
For this, an adaptation of the Linked Data Platform (LDP) 
specification <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-7">7</a>]</span> was introduced.
This LDP interface provides a direct
view on the authoritative structure
of data as documents on the pod.
It defines the hierarchical document structure
as relations of resources (documents) and containers,
similar to files and directories on a file system.
The user can then use the set of HTTP(s) operations 
provided by the specification to interact with the documents.
`
<!-- user control -->
In this system, authorization for the Solid pod
is similarly based on the document structure of the pod.
There are two available specifications: 
the Web Access Controls specification (WAC) <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-8">8</a>]</span> 
and the Access Control Policy (ACP) <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-9">9</a>]</span> specification.
Both enable user control in the permissions they can control
for both the documents and the containers (directories) in the pod document hierarchy.
In broad terms, these allow the user 
(or application if given permission) to control
which actors can read, write edit and control
these documents and containers in the Solid pod.</p>

        <!-- the encoding of semantics -->
        <p>The final concept we are look at here is the 
ability for applications to encode 
semantic information in their data.
itself  to encode semantics into the
data on a Solid pod is made possible by the 
distinction between RDF-documents and non-RDF documents.
Documents stored in an RDF format are handled by the 
pod as data documents. They support the updating of
data in the document via HTTP(S) PATCH and mark 
their presence for applications as data documents.
Data can be stored in other formats, but these 
formats such as JSON usually do not include enough
context for other applications to work with this data.</p>

        <h3 id="the-problem-of-assumptions-in-applications">The problem of assumptions in applications</h3>
        <!-- problem statement -->
        <p>The current Solid ecosystem 
is still very limited in scale,
and only span a handful of working solutions 
and prototypes <a href="">TODO::cite??</a>.
However, even on this limited scale,
we can perceive how the current interpretation
of the vision for the Web as a document-centric ecosystem
leads to mismatched expectations <a href="">TODO::wording</a>.</p>

        <!-- #### the separation of application and data -->
        <!-- mismatch in storage -->
        <p>The current implementation of the Solid pod
provides a way for users to control the storage
of their personal data on the Web.
However, as it bases itself on a document hierarchy
for data storage, we end up in a situation that
invites local assumptions of applications.
Applications in the current ecosystem often require
additional information for integrating data data.
They include in their application logic that the
<code>/contacts/</code> folder contains documents with contact information,
or how the <code>/contacts/</code> URI returns contacts of the current user.
This information is not available in the data itself, 
but is encoded in the context of its retrieval over 
specific interfaces or from specific documents.
In the same way, the degrees of freedom left open
by the LDP interface allows applications to encode 
their data in any way they please over the interface.</p>

        <p>Assumptions can be encoded in how data is transformed into separate
documents or how these documents are structured in the pod hierarchy. 
Through this document system and its ability to encode assumptions,
the ecosystem is easy to adopt for applications,
but results in a tight coupling between applications and their
published data on the pod. Integrating data from many 
pods in such an environment may again require the
integration of all these assumptions, bringing us back 
to the current situation.
Solutions are being developed to work around the limitations
of the current document-centric implementation, 
such as the TypeIndex specification <a href="">TODO::cite</a>.
However, these are often still too focused on solving
problems created by the design choices of the implementation,
rather than being a natural consequence of the envisioned ecosystem.</p>

        <!-- #### user control -->
        <!-- mismatch of user control -->
        <p>In terms of user control in the ecosystem,
the current authorization systems are restricted to 
the documents and containers of the Solid pod document hierarchy.
This limits user control of their data to the
documents over which this data is spread.
Additionally, the granularity is now indirectly
controlled by how applications decide to store
user data on their Solid pod as documents.
Because of this, applications may try 
to optimize their data structuring for 
maximum control over specific data,
where others might just write everything as one document.
Next to problems with user control,
applications are now invited to encode 
additional assumptions as to how the control
of the data should managed in the document structure.
This exacerbates the problem of local decisions 
leading to further mismatched assumptions between applications.</p>

        <!-- #### enriching data through semantics -->
        <p>An important second aspect storage alone fails to capture
is the requirement for data to be <em>independent</em> of applications,
through capturing important semantic information in the data itself.
The current implementation offers some specific features 
for documents that are tagged as only containing RDF data.
These RDF-documents support additional functionality for 
PATCH requests to update the documents without overwriting them.
There is also the requirement for all auxiliary resources to be
stored in an RDF format.</p>

        <h3 id="a-shift-in-interpretation">A shift in interpretation</h3>
        <p>In this document-centric interpretation,
we see the requirement of a more data-focused
vision appearing through multiple initiatives.
Native to the Solid LDP specification,
documents containing only RDF data are
provided with additional functionality to update
the contained data without changing the resources.
Other optimizations try to work around the
limitations of the LDP interface by providing
other query interfaces over the Solid pod.
An optional SPARQL interface for the Solid pod
was originally included in the Solid specification <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]</span>/
Similarly, the Enterprise Solid Server <a href="">TODO::cite</a>
provides an optional Quad Pattern Fragements 
endpoint interface to their Solid pods.
These additional interfaces clearly show 
an interest in moving the ecosystem to be less 
document focused, and put the querying of data 
more central in the process.</p>

        <h3 id="a-distilled-knowledge-graph-interpretation">A distilled knowledge graph interpretation</h3>
        <!-- The document-centric vision as a KG -->
        <p>To improve upon these problems, 
we see attempts at reconciling the document hierarchy
of the Solid pod with the interpretation as a knowledge graph.
Already in the early iterations of the Solid protocol,
the shortcomings of the LDP interface in terms of 
querying were already mentioned <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]</span>.
To combat this, extensions to the LDP specification were proposed,
and an optional SPARQL interface could be provided
by the Solid pod to enable more complex data retrieval.
More recently, the Enterprise Solid Server implementation by Inrupt 
also started providing an optional QPF-endpoint interface
over the documents in their Solid pods. <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-10">10</a>]</span>. 
In this perspective of the Solid pod document hierarchy
as a knowledge graph, the document organization is no longer
a limiting factor for interoperability.
Applications can query directly on the (RDF) data that is present
in these documents, even though this data may be spread across 
hundreds of documents with different organizations of data in the pod.
This perspective of a Solid pod as a knowledge graph is also 
not limited to the server, as this distillation process
from document hierarchy to knowledge graph
can happen fully on the client side over the LDP interface.</p>

        <!-- Still has problems -->
        <p>However, even with this perspective on the Solid pod, 
where the document organization of the Solid pod is ignored,
we still run into its limitations:
(i) The problem of the organization of data
is removed, but other applications coding assumptions against the 
document hierarchy are still limited in interoperability, 
and do not share the incentive to write rich semantic data to the pod.
(ii) Writing data is still constrained to the document hierarchy,
as all data must be stored in the context of a document on the pod.
This maintains the problems of writing to common
documents and containers.
(iii) The distillation process from document hierarchy to knowledge graph
is open to client interpretation, and may be limited by client understanding
or include interface-specific information such as document last modified information.
(iv) The management of permissions is still
tied to the document hierarchy of the Solid pod, and cannot be
defined in terms of the individual statements in the data.</p>

        <p>Where the current innovation surface for the Solid ecosystem is far from reached,
we already feel the constraints imposed by the document hierarchy limiting the options.
Even in its current small scale, 
the ecosystem is limited in interoperability 
and user control of their data.
New innovations in the ecosystem
such as the application interoperability specification <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-11">11</a>]</span>
and research in the possibility for GDPR compliance <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-12">12</a>]</span>
are limited by the imposed document structure,
and have to work around these limitations.</p>

        <p>Because of this, we feel that a shift in perspective is necessary 
for the Solid ecosystem to evolve in a way that promotes longevity 
in their solutions, and a way that maximizes the innovations 
we can build on the ecosystem.</p>

<div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
        <h2 property="schema:name">The Solid pod as a permissioned Knowledge Graph</h2>
        <p>In the previous section, we outlined the current interpretation 
of Solid as a document-centric ecosystem, where the Solid pod takes the role 
of a permissioned document hierarchy. We demonstrated that even when querying
the Solid pod as a Knowledge graph, interoperability in the ecosystem is still
constrained by its document-centric interpretation.</p>

        <p>Where an ecosystem built on the sharing of documents on the Web
provides a limited surface for innovation,
an ecosystem built on the sharing of data,
not limited to a specific document hierarchy
provides more opportunities for innovation.</p>

        <p>This leads us to propose the definition of the Solid pod as <em>fundamentally being a permissioned, hybrid knowledge graph, exposed through Web APIs</em>.
This understanding of the Solid pod shifts the premise from data contained in documents to documents built on top of data.</p>

        <!-- permissioned -->
        <p>With <em>permissioned</em>, we express the ability to manage permissions over any individual nodes and relation in the knowledge graph.
Note that we use this term to lean close to the current proposition for user control in Solid, 
but that we recognize the term <em>parameterized</em> as a potential evolution, where next to only user permissions,
any number of parameters can be retained for the individual nodes and relations in the knowledge graph. 
<!-- hybdid -->
<em>hybrid</em> expresses the ability of the knowledge graph to store any kind of data as nodes in the knowledge graph 
in the form of blobs, for which metadata can be maintained in the knowledge graph.
<!-- knowledge grap -->
For the term <em>knowledge graph</em>, 
we adopt the definition proposed in <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-13">13</a>]</span>:
“<em>Herein we adopt an inclusive definition, 
where we view a knowledge graph as a graph of data intended to accumulate and convey knowledge of the real world,
whose nodes represent entities of interest and whose edges represent relations between these entities. 
The graph of data (aka data graph) conforms to a graph-based data model, 
which may be a directed edge-labelled graph, a property graph, etc.</em>”
<!-- Web APIs -->
And finally, the definition states that this knowledge graph can be exposed using <em>any suitable Web API</em>,
so that the possibilities of the ecosystem are not constrained by the capabilities of any specific API.</p>

        <h3 id="a-fundamentally-different-interpretation">A fundamentally different interpretation</h3>
        <!-- The interpretation -->
        <p>With the proposed definition, we want to provide a zoomed-out perspective on the current state of the Solid ecosystem.
Where in the current ecosystem, the document hierarchy of a Solid pod is constraining factor,
it can instead be perceived as one of the many possibilities
of representing the internal knowledge graph of a Solid pod.
By shifting the interpretation of the document hierarchy from the authoritative source
to a representation on the data in the Solid pod, we can construct any number of hierarchies 
over the Pod knowledge graph.
These can be built on the Solid pod server, or can be created at the client
over the APIs that are exposed by the Solid pod.</p>

        <!-- The current Solid protocol as a KG -->
        <p>Note that this interpretation of the ecosystem 
does not invalidate the current Solid protocol.
It however changes the implication
of the exposed LDP interface of the Solid pod
from maintaining the Solid pod document hierarchy,
to being a possible representation of the internal data state.
Where the current ecosystem restricts permissions to the document
hierarchy of the LDP interface, the zoomed-out perspective
enables the construction of the document hierarchy based on 
the permissions set in the pod knowledge graph.
By only including data in documents for which permissions are set,
we can reuse the current protocols 
but shift their position in the ecosystem to better 
reflect their function as an interface on the data in the Solid pod.</p>

        <p>However, not all translations are seamless.
Where a knowledge graph can be distilled from a document hierarchy,
the inverse operation require additional semantics,
such as the use of named graphs in the data of the pod knowledge graph,
as is currently proposed for the optional query interfaces of the Solid pods.
Similarly, the current authorization protocols in their current state can be reused
only to set permissions for the subset of data in a document for which this is allowed,
as they cannot be used to manage permissions for single data entries in a document.</p>

        <!-- conclusion -->
        <p>The attempts to improve queries on top 
of the current Solid ecosystem 
through optional SPARQL <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]</span> 
or QPF <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-10">10</a>]</span> interfaces,
demonstrates the requirement
for a knowledge-graph interpretation
of the Solid pod in at least a query perspective.
We conclude that where the current Solid protocol,
built on the LDP and WAC/ACP specifications,
tries to emulate a permissioned knowledge graph,
it falls short of the intended goals.
Through the zoomed-out perspective of the Solid pod
as a knowledge graph exposed over Web APIs, 
we shift the focus back to the data itself
and reframe the interfaces as a means to an end.</p>

being fundamentally a permissioned, hybrid knowledge graph, 
exposed through Web APIs.</p>

        <!-- what does it do -->
        <p>Through this zoomed-out perspective of the ecosystem
we define an innovation space that is not constrained 
by specific protocols, but that can build upon the current 
protocols to provide more general solutions for the 
challenges faced by the ecosystem.</p>

        <!-- how does it build -->
        <p>By reframing the current protocols for managing data (LDP) 
and authorization (WAC/ACP) into interfaces exposing an 
internal knowledge graph of the Solid pod,
we can re-use these protocols in a new setting.
By shifting the understanding from a data graph 
created over a document system,
towards a document system,
dynamically created over a data graph,
we can fundamentally shift the understanding of the ecosystem
towards a graph-centric interpretation.</p>

        <p>Though we do not propose any specific takeaway as to which interfaces 
may be better suited to provide solutions in the current ecosystem,
we invite the reader to think along in how this zoomed-out perspective of the ecosystem
can lead to better solutions to the problems faced by the ecosystem today.</p>

        <p><br />
What’s in a pod? <em>It’s in the eye of the beholder</em>, not in the constraints of the interface.</p>
