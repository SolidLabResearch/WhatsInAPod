      <h2 property="schema:name">Abstract</h2>
      <!-- Context      -->
      <p>The Solid vision aims to make data independent of applications
through technical specifications,
which detail how to publish and consume permissioned data
across multiple autonomous locations called <q>Pods</q>.
<!-- Need         -->
This envisaged independence is not fully realized
by the current document-centric interpretation
wherein a Pod is solely a collection of Linked Data documents,
leading to fundamental interoperability and query problems.
Furthermore,
the broader longterm vision for Solid is confounded
with the concrete HTTP interface to Pods today,
leading to a narrower solution space for these problems.
<!-- Task         -->
We examined the mismatch between the vision
and the prevalent document-centric interpretation,
and propose a graph-centric interpretation
wherein a Pod is fundamentally a knowledge graph.
<!-- Object       -->
In this article,
we contrast the existing and proposed interpretations
in terms of how they realize the Solid vision.
We argue that the knowledge-centric interpretation
improves Pod access through different Web APIs
that act as views in a database sense.
<!-- Findings     -->
We show that our zoomed-out interpretation
provides improved opportunities for
storage, publication, and querying of decentralized data
in more flexible and sustainable ways.
<!-- Conclusion   -->
These insights are crucial to reduce
the dependency of Solid apps on implicit API semantics
and local assumptions about the shape and organization of data
and the resulting performance.
<!-- Perspectives -->
The suggested broader interpretation supports Solid with
its evolution into a heterogeneous yet interoperable ecosystem
that accommodates a multitude of read/write data access patterns.</p>

      <h2 property="schema:name">The Solid vision</h2>
      <!-- problem: your data being everywhere, no control very limited interoperability -->
      <p>In the current Web 2.0 ecosystem, 
the concepts of data ownership and privacy have lost a lot of meaning,
as data that is often user generated is stored in centralized data silos
which is often out of user control.
In this system, the user neither has the control nor the knowledge of to how their data is used in the online space <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]</span>.
<!-- Solid: a vision for a better Web -->
As a response to this, the Solid project was created with the aim of revitalizing the Web <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]</span>.
Where centralized data silos create an ecosystem of limited integration, limited availability and limited innovation,
Tim Berners-Lee’s Solid brings a new vision for an ecosystem on the Web,
based on the concepts of application interoperability and user control.
<!-- ecosystem goal: control over data, interoperability over applications and data -->
An ecosystem that empowers integration and innovation 
through the separation of applications and data 
that puts users back in control of their data<span class="references">[<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]</span>.</p>

      <!-- the Solid pod -->
      <p>Introducing the concept of the personal online datastore (pod), 
the Solid pod forms the foundation of the ecosystem as 
a storage space where users are in control of their data,
creating a decentralized network of Solid pods
where applications can integrate data through user consent,
in contrast to the Web 2.0 architecture where applications are required to integrate data 
through APIs exposed by centralized data silos,
and user control is at the mercy of the platform maintaining the user data <a href="">TODO:: good citation</a>.</p>

      <!-- key for achieving requirement: capture semantics in the data -->
      <p>A key component for achieving this decentralized ecosystem 
of separation of application from data 
is the capturing of required semantic information in the data itself,
so that applications can work with the data independent 
of the origin and API over which the data is retrieved.
This in contrast to the current Web 2.0 architecture,
where necessary semantics for the data are often provided out of band,
through agreements in the ecosystem or documentation of a specific APIs
that applications need to integrate in their application logic.
In this way, the Solid ecosystem marks a transition
from a Web ecosystem of API integration towards
a Web ecosystem centered around data integration <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-3">3</a>]</span>.</p>

      <!-- Now this vision has to be made a reality -->
      <p>From the vision of this ecosystem, 
a challenge is now presented for the Web in how these concepts
can be captured in specific specifications that can 
create this envisioned ecosystem for the Web.
<!-- The vision is room for many interpretations -->
As the proposed vision is is based on broad concepts,
the realization of these concepts can take many different forms.
<!-- there is no authoritative definition -->
With no authoritative definition currently available for Solid,
the understanding of the ecosystem is not always shared in the ecosystem,
leading to misunderstandings and mismatching of the existing systems and application assumptions.</p>

      <p>With this work,
we describe the two main interpretations of the Solid ecosystem we discern today. 
In <a href="#documentcentric">Section 2</a>, we describe the document-centric interpretation of the ecosystem,
the current focus on this interpretation in the majority of implementations,
and the shortcomings in terms of interoperability.
Next, we describe the graph-centric interpretation of the Solid ecosysten in <a href="#graphcentric">Section 3</a>,
where we propose the definition of the Solid Pod being fundamentally a permissioned, hybrid knowledge graph
as a necessary interpretation to expand the innovation potential for the ecosystem.
In <a href="#comparison">Section 4</a>, we compare the two interpretations and their consequences for the ecosystem, 
after which we bring our conclusions in <a href="#conclusion">Section 5</a>.</p>

  <section id="documentcentric" inlist="" rel="schema:hasPart" resource="#documentcentric">
<div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
      <h2 property="schema:name">The Solid pod as a permissioned document hierarchy</h2>
      <!-- The first interpretation we look at is document-centric. -->
      <p>The envisioned Solid ecosystem in its current state is not well defined, 
and leaves room for different interpretations of the concepts proposed in the vision.
In this section, we present the currently frequently shared understanding of Solid
as a document-centric ecosystem, where the Solid pod is fundamentally understood
as a permissioned document hierarchy.</p>

      <!-- data and files stored as documents on the pod -->
      <p>In this interpretation of the ecosystem,
the premise of separation of application and data is approached 
from the perspective of the Solid pods as a document storage system.
The Solid pod manages all data as documents in a hierarchical ordering of documents
and containers, similarly to how a file system handles data as files ad directories.
By introducing the concepts of RDF and non-RDF resources (documents),
data in the network can be converted to a document in an RDF format for representing data 
in the network, and non-RDF documents for data that is not in an RDF format.
These documents are then published over the Web in an environment
where the users are in control over how the data is shared 
by managing the permissions of the documents stored on their data pod.
This way, the envisioned Solid ecosystem is presented as a document-centric ecosystem
where interoperability is based on integration of the available documents by applications in the network
and user control is maintained on the document level through the management of permissions.
This interpretation of the ecosystem is supported by the current version of the Solid specification <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-4">4</a>]</span>
through the introduction of <em>slash semantics</em>,
where the hierarchical relationships between documents and their parent container is defined
through the slash (/) characters in their URIs.</p>

      <!-- Solid uses an adaptation of LDP spec to interact with data on pod -->
      <!-- The current specifications chosen to build the Solid ecosystem on have a focus on the document-centric interpretation for the ecosystem,
where all data is stored as resources (documents) in a hierarchic system of resources and containers,
similar to how a file system stores data in files and directories.
As a consequence, the specifications currently used to build this ecosystem
and the specifications being developed to solve problems with the ecosystem
are based on the notion of working with data as documents. -->

      <!-- read/write interface  -->
      <p>The enable users and applications to create and interact with documents stored on the Solid pod,
an adaptation of the Linked Data Platform (LDP) specification <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-5">5</a>]</span> was introduced.
This LDP interface represents the authoritative organization of documents on the Solid pod as a
hierarchical organization of resources (documents) and containers.
Apart from the restriction of representing data as documents, 
and organizing these documents in a hierarchical structure,
the interface has no restrictions on the ways 
applications and users can structure their data over the interface
as documents on the pod.</p>

      <!--  The authorization interface -->
      <p>Similarly, the current authorization mechanisms for the Solid pod are based on the document structure of the pod.
There are currently two specifications that are being used to manage authorization in the Solid ecosystem:
the Web Access Controls specification (WAC) <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-6">6</a>]</span> and the Access Control Policy (ACP) <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-7">7</a>]</span> specification.
Where both specifications differ in their handling of permissions,
both work on top of the notion of the Solid pod being a document hierarchy,
where the granularity through which data sharing can be managed
is limited by the granularity of the documents storing this data on the Solid pod.
As these documents can be managed by applications, 
the applications can indirectly control the granularity of permissions on the user data pod.</p>

      <h3 id="application-interoperability-in-the-document-centric-ecosystem">Application interoperability in the document-centric ecosystem</h3>
      <!-- Interoperability problems -->
      <p>With the current Solid ecosystem delivering the specifications as is, 
based on an interpretation of the Solid vision as an document-centric ecosystem,
developers are left with many degrees of freedom in their interpretation of the ecosystem,
and how data should be stored in the document structure of the Solid pods.
To develop an ecosystem on these specifications that is centered around the concepts of interoperability 
and user control, applications are forced to integrate the concepts of the Solid vision using the 
available specifications in a way that they assume will conform to these requirements,
where local solutions and optimizations lead to assumptions that are not necessarily shared by the rest of the ecosystem.</p>

      <!-- This proposes Solid as a document-centric ecosystem. -->
      <p>In a practical example of this concept, we take two applications in this ecosystem
that work with the same type of data, such as contact information, and both write this data to the Solid pod.
<!-- hierarchy mismatch -->
Both applications may make totally different assumptions of how they structure their contact data in documents,
and where they store these documents in the pod document hierarchy.
Because of this, both applications may not know other contact information is available on the pod,
or even if they scout the Solid pod for additional data, the structuring of the other contact information
may be different in structure to a point that it has become unreadable for the other application 
that holds the assumption that contact data should be structured differently.
<!-- writing same location -->
In case both applications want to forcibly write to the same location,
e.g. a container <code>/contacts/</code> on the pod, 
they can create problems with overwriting data, 
or may just create extra documents in this container
that follow different rules to data structuring,
creating issues or even crashing other applications that hold specific assumptions 
to the structuring of data on the Solid pod.
<!-- permission management -->
Additionally, the management of permissions is also indirectly connected to the applications writing data to the Solid pod.
As authorization systems are tied to the document hierarchy of the Solid pod,
the sharing of this data is limited to the created document structure by applications.
As one application might split its contact information in different documents, 
creating a more granular system for sharing parts of contact information,
the other application might assume the whole contact to be a single document on the pod.
This creates issues where one application given access to data by another application leads to 
a mismatch in data sharing, as either not enough data is shared, as the assumption that all data for a contact
should be contained in a single resource does not hold,
or inversely it creates the situation where an app that only requests the name and WebID values for your contacts
now must get access to either all or none of the available information on these contacts, 
as contacts are stored as a single document containing all information on that contact.
This mismatch in the granularity of data, combined with the assumptions of applications in the generation of these data documents,
leads to problems in the sharing of data, and limits the control users can exercise on this data.</p>

      <p>The above described ecosystem, defined by the interperatation of Solid as a document-centric ecosystem,
invites problems in interoperability between applications,
as data granularity is limited to documents generated by assumptions in application logic,
and the hierarchical organization of these documents on the Solid pod invite assumptions
to the structuring of data on the Solid pod.
It provides an innovation surface that is limited by the capabilities of the document-centric 
interpretation and design for the ecosystem and the interfaces exposed by the Solid pods.</p>

      <h3 id="a-distilled-knowledge-graph-representation">A distilled knowledge graph representation</h3>
      <!-- The docuemnt-centric vision as a KG -->
      <p>To improve upon these problems, 
we clearly see initiatives trying to reconcile the 
document-centric nature of the ecosystem with the perspective
of treating the data stored in these documents as a Knowledge Graph.
Back in the early iterations of the Solid protocol,
the shortcomings of the LDP interface in terms of 
querying were already mentioned. Originally these proposed
the inclusion of extensions to the used LDP specification,
as well as an optional SPARQL interface for the Solid pod 
to resolve these issues.
This perspective of the Solid pod document hierarchy as a 
Knowledge Graph solves a lot of issues in terms of interoperability,
as the organization of data in the document hierarchy does not matter
for the knowledge graph distilled from these documents enables
applications to work directly on the data itself without 
requiring any assumptions of the data organization in the document
hierarchy of the Solid pod.
The provision of an endpoint is also not a core requirement, 
as this distillation process can happen fully on the client side.
Recently, the Enterprise Solid Server implementation by Inrupt 
provided another implementation of this concept
by including an optional QPF-endpoint interface 
for the Solid pods hosted over their server implementation. <a href="">TODO::citation</a>.</p>

      <!-- Still has problems -->
      <p>However, even with this perspective on the Solid pod, 
where the document organization of the data in the Solid pod is ignored,
we still run into limitations caused by the document hierarchy of the Solid pod.
Where the problem of the data organization is mitigated, 
as other applications are free to ignore this perspective,
the incentive to add semantic enrichment to written data is low.
As this perspective only uses the knowledge graph 
in a query context, writing data to the pod still requires
the wrapping of this data in arbitrary document structures,
and may incur problems for other applications when writing to common
containers or documents.
And finally, the management of permissions is still
tied to the document hierarchy of the Solid pod, and cannot be
defined in terms of the individual statements in the data.</p>

      <p>Although this perspective resolves interoperability issues faced by the ecosystem,
these and other issues caused by the document hierarchy of the Solid pod
still limit the innovation surface of the ecosystem, even in this perspective.</p>

<div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
      <h2 property="schema:name">The Solid pod as a permissioned Knowledge Graph</h2>
      <p>In the previous section, we outlined the most common interpretation 
of Solid as a document-centric ecosystem, where the Solid pod takes the role 
of a permissioned document hierarchy. We demonstrated that even when querying
the Solid pod as a Knowledge graph, interoperability in the ecosystem is still
constrained by its document-centric interpretation.</p>

      <p>This conclusion lead us to <a href="">TODO:: this</a>.</p>

      <p>Therefore, we propose the definition of <em>the Solid pod as fundamentally being a permissioned, hybrid knowledge graph, exposed through Web APIs.”</em>.
<!-- permissioned -->
With the term <em>permissioned</em>, we express the ability to manage permissions over any individual nodes and relation in the knowledge graph.
Note that we use this term to lean close to the current proposition for user control in Solid, 
but that we recognize the term <em>parameterized</em> as a potential evolution, where next to only user permissions,
any number of parameters can be retained for the individual nodes and relations in the knowledge graph. 
<!-- hybdid -->
The term <em>hybrid</em> expresses the ability of the knowledge graph to store any kind of data as nodes in the knowledge graph 
in the form of blobs, for which metadata can be maintained in the knowledge graph.
<!-- knowledge grap -->
For the term <em>knowledge graph</em>, 
we adopt the definition proposed by <a href="">TODO:: how to do this citation????</a>:
“<em>Herein we adopt an inclusive definition, 
where we view a knowledge graph as a graph of data intended to accumulate and convey knowledge of the real world,
whose nodes represent entities of interest and whose edges represent relations between these entities. 
The graph of data (aka data graph) conforms to a graph-based data model, 
which may be a directed edge-labelled graph, a property graph, etc.</em>”
<!-- Web APIs -->
And finally, the definition states that this knowledge graph can be exposed using any suitable Web API,
so that we do not constrain the possibilities of the ecosystem to the capabilities of any specific API.</p>

      <p class="comment" data-author="RD">Ruben V, can you specifically reread the above section to make sure I did not mess up?</p>

      <h3 id="a-fundamentally-different-interpretation">A fundamentally different interpretation</h3>
      <!-- The interpretation -->
      <p>With the proposed definition, we want to provide a shift in interpretation from the ecosystem.
Where in the current ecosystem, the document hierarchy of a Solid pod is constraining factor,
it can instead be perceived as one of the many possible interfaces
that can be constructed over the internal knowledge graph of the Solid pod.
In this new interpretation of the ecosystem, the document hierarchy then no longer defines the 
authoritative source for the ordering of data on the Solid pod,
but can be used to represent any number of hierarchies over the data in the knowledge graph of the Solid pod,
based on the requirements and assumption of applications interacting with the Solid pod.
In this ecosystem, the innovation surface is no longer constrained by a single 
document hierarchy that forms the authoritative source for the data on the Solid pod, 
but by a knowledge graph that can be exposed over any suitable API and over which you can construct any number of document hierarchies.</p>

      <!-- advantages  -->
      <p>In this interpretation of the ecosystem
any application can write their data to the pod knowledge graph.
Where in a document structure, implications of which application wrote which data is often
captured in the semantics of the location of a document in the hierarchy,
a knowledge-graph based model requires the semantics of these interactions to be captured in the data.
This way, users can</p>

      <p>In terms of control, the knowledge graph definition of the Solid pod 
does not impose any restriction on the modeling and management
of these permissions on the internal data graph.</p>

      <p><span class="todo">expand this advantages section.</span></p>

      <!-- The current Solid protocol as a KG -->
      <p>We note that the proposed interpretation of the Solid ecosystem 
does not invalidate the current Solid protocol.
It however changes the implication of the exposed LDP interface of the Solid pod
from the authoritative source of data, to an interface over the internal 
knowledge graph held by the Solid pod.
Here, the documents in the LDP hierarchy can provide 
views on the internal data, over which the permission mechanisms
can be retasked to manage controls over specific views 
on the internal knowledge graph, instead of 
managing views over arbitrary data documents 
generated by applications.</p>

      <!-- With this work, we propose perspective of Solid as ...  -->
      <p>With this work, we proposed the interpretation of the Solid pod being fundamentally a permissioned, hybrid knowledge graph, exposed through Web APIs. 
<!-- Argue this perspective in itself does not solve the existing difficulties in interoperability  -->
To create the envisioned ecosystem, 
where we can move assumptions captured in the application logic and the document structure
into the semantics of the data itself,
we argue that this zoomed out perspective is necessary to develop meaningful solutions that promote longevity in their approach.
<!-- Make case that LDP limits the innovation surface for Solid -->
We argue that the current document-centric interpretation of the Solid ecosystem,
where the Linked Data Platform specification is central to the notion of what constitutes a Solid pod,
promotes a development process of applications making local assumptions and optimizations over the document hierarchy of the Solid pod.
<!-- How do we impove -->
In contrast, the interpretation of the Solid pod as a permissioned, hybrid knowledge graph,
provides a wider innovation surface, that builds upon the current ecosystem without invalidating the protocols in place. 
<!-- A practical example -->
By changing the role of the LDP interface
from defining the authoritative organization of data 
to providing an interface over an internal knowledge graph,
we can construct any hierarchy over the data suitable for the application,
and are not limited by assumptions of other applications when writing their data.
This way, we change the interface from a limiting factor of the ecosystem,
to enabling interoperability by not restricting the internal data to a single hierarchy.
<!-- An enabler of innovation -->
Through this zoomed out perspective on the role of the Solid pod in the Solid ecosystem, 
we hope to inspire the reader to think along for the innovations that this interpretation of the ecosystem enables,
and to view the current ecosystem as a subset of the possible innovations that Solid can enable.
What’s in a Pod? <em>It’s in the eye of the beholder</em>, not in the constraints of an interface.</p>

      <!-- The perspective continues from the current state of solid and is completely compatible with the current state -->
      <p>We note again that this interpretation proposed in this work does not go against the current Solid protocol,
and should be viewed as an attempt to zoom out the current perspective on Solid,
and provide a framing of the ecosystem that promotes solutions aimed at interoperability and the longevity of the ecosystem.
<!-- The goal of this work is to provide a perspective on the identity of Solid that can help in future work on the topic -->
We do not propose any specific takeaway as to which interfaces may provide solutions for faced difficulties, 
but we hope that the ideas proposed can form the base of new discussions and solutions to tackle the difficulties faced by the ecosystem.</p>
