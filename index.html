      <h2 property="schema:name">Introduction</h2>
      <p>In the current state of the Web of large platforms storing enormous amounts of data in their own data silos, 
the Solid project brings a revitalization of the concepts of data ownership and identity on the Web.
Proposed in 2016 as a decentralized platform for social Web applications <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]</span>, 
<a href="">TODO:: more</a></p>

      <p>As the specifications evolved over the years, the definitions on what Solid actually is have evolved as well.</p>

      <p>The use of the Linked Data Platform specification as the interface to interact with the data stored on a Solid pod …</p>

      <p>The current Web has come a long way from it’s initial vision.
Originally designed as a decentralized network of computers serving and retrieving data form and to the network, 
data has become more centralized as data traffic converged to centralized platforms that span billions of accounts.</p>

      <p>As a response to this, the Solid project was introduced by sir. Tim Berners Lee, the inventor of the original Web<a href="">TODO:: this is a weak intro</a>.
Solid was presented as a data platform enabling a decentralized Web of personal online datastores(PODs)
by building on existing web standards <a href="">TODO:: cite</a>.
The Linked Data Platform specification was chosen as a way to organize data on a data pod.
<a href="">TODO:: write some good flavour text above. Maybe yoink some from other papers</a></p>

      <!-- 
We see that in the current state, the specification has started to define the platform, where the use of Linked Data Platform to organize data on a data pod leads to local assumptions being made in applications on how data organization in a data pod should be handled.

In this work, we propose the vision of Solid as a platform of data pods containing an internal Knowledge Graph that can expose this knowledge graph over a multitude of interfaces. 
-->

      <p>The goal of the Solid platform is to present a platform that separates applications and data, creating an ecosystem where multiple applications can seamlessly work with the same data <a href="">TODO::cite from somewhere? ask Ruben V?</a>.</p>

      <p>However, as the specifications evolved, we see an evolution in direction of Solid being equated to the specifications used to implement the vision, as opposed to the original vision of a next step for the Web to provide separation between data and applications.</p>

      <p>Next to this, we also notice a lack of an authoritative definition for Solid.</p>

      <p>This lack of a proper definition, combined with the evolution of the implementation of Solid, has as a consequence that people start to equate their definitions and expectations of the Solid platform and ecosystems to the implementations, <a href="">more than on the original vision of what Solid can do for the Web. TODO:: …?</a></p>

      <p>In <a href="#problem_statement">Section 2</a>, we define how a mismatch in organization and real-world structure of data can lead to problems through local assumptions and optimizations by applications.
<a href="#vision">Section 3</a> shows the proposed perspective of viewing Solid data pods as permissioned knowledge graphs that can be exposed over a multitude of APIs.
In <a href="#comparison">Section 4</a>, we argue through comparisons of specific use-cases how interfaces influence the organization and structure of the data, and can lead to coupling between application and data through localized assumptions, after which a conclusion is formulated in <a href="#conclusion">Section 5</a>.</p>

      <h2 property="schema:name">Problem statement</h2>
      <p>With the goal of facilitating the integration of data for applications over the Web,
the Solid platform provides a set of open standards to manage and interact with data in a Personal Online Datastore (POD).
The protocol to read, write and organize data on Solid data pods is based on the Linked Data Platform (LDP) specification <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]</span>. 
The Linked Data Platform specification defines the operations on and interactions with resources over the Web using HTTP(S).
It defines the concepts of containers and resources to organize data, which similarly to a file system create a hierarchic storage structure of containers (~directories) containing resources (~files) and other containers.
These resources can be non-RDF resources such as images, word documents, … as well as RDF resources, which are a collection of RDF data formatted according to an RDF data format.
<a href="">TODO:: maybe I should have a separate section introducing the concepts of LDP, Solid, …?</a>
The Solid protocol adopts an adapted version of this specification, including HTTP PUT for direct control over resource naming and location.</p>

      <h3 id="a-need-for-definition">A need for definition</h3>

      <p>As we search for an authoritative definition on what a Solid pod entails, we find multiple definitions:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>sambra et al
          <ul>
            <li>This paper presents Solid, a decentralized platform for social Web applications</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>https:/​/​solidproject.org/
          <ul>
            <li>Solid is a specification that lets people store their data securely in decentralized data stores called Pods. Pods are like secure personal web servers for data. When data is stored in someone’s Pod, they control which people and applications can access it.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>https:/​/​inrupt.com/solid/
          <ul>
            <li>Solid is a technology for organizing data, applications, and identities on the web. Solid enables richer choices for people, organizations and app developers by building on existing web standards.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>We notice a lack of proper definition for Solid, nor a guideline for used terminology (protocol, platform, ecosystem, …).</p>

      <h3 id="solid-is-about-splitting-apps-and-data">Solid is about splitting apps and data</h3>
      <p>A key requirement for this is the splitting of applications and data, and the storage of semantics in the data itself.</p>

      <h3 id="solid-as-a-linked-data-platform-interface">Solid as a Linked Data Platform interface</h3>

      <p>LDP as a meta-API where applications are able to model their data needs.
It puts constraints on the data - resource granularity, hierarchical structuring, but also leaves degrees of freedom used to create additional semantics not captured in the data.
This freedom is used to create API’s in the data through local assumptions creating semantics that may not be captured in the data itself.
Little support for interoperability in its base form.</p>

      <h4 id="a-mismatch-between-data-organization-and-the-real-world">A mismatch between data organization and the real world</h4>
      <p>is often caused by the Linked Data Platform interface being restrictive in the way data can be organized over the interface.
The Linked Data Platform specification organizes data in a hierarchical structure, where real-world data does not always follow a hierarchical structure.</p>

      <h4 id="semantics-in-data-organization">Semantics in data organization</h4>
      <p>in applications and</p>

      <h4 id="localized-assumptions-and-optimizations">Localized assumptions and optimizations</h4>
      <p>made by applications in the structure of data stored on a data pod leads to …</p>

      <h4 id="applications-indirectly-dictate-the-permission-structure">Applications indirectly dictate the permission structure</h4>
      <p>in their structuring of data on the data pod.
As applications structure data stored on the data pod, 
the resulting data organization on the pod dictates how permissions can be set over this data.
As the data is structured in resources using the hierarchical structuring of the Linked Data Platform interface,
permission granularity over this data is limited to the size of the chosen resources, and not on individual data triples in these resources (in case of RDF resources).
Additionally, interactions with this data is limited to the structuring of these resources, as <a href="">TODO:: what more should we put here??</a>.</p>

      <hr />

      <h4 id="data-granularity">Data granularity</h4>
      <p>A consequence of using this specification is that data must be organized in resources, as this is the only form of data that can be managed using Linked Data Platform. This requires applications to make local assumptions as to what constitutes a resource and how application data should be distributed over resources in a data pod. As resources are the only interface, other data structures such as databases are impossible, and must be emulated on the client side over the resources exposed by the LDP interface.</p>

      <h4 id="organizational-semantics">Organizational semantics</h4>
      <p>As resources are stored in a hierarchical way due to the nature of the Linked Data Platform specification, the organization of data in a hierarchical order may carry implicit semantics in the organization of resources on a data pod. We see this return in the original paper<span class="references">[<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]</span>, where the example is given of an application storing events using a URI path structure based on dates (i.e., /2016/05/01/event1). The problem with these localized assumptions is they do not hold for the ecosystem, and form an application specific API built on Linked Data Platform <a href="">TODO:: what more?</a>.</p>

      <h4 id="hierarchical-bias">Hierarchical bias</h4>
      <p>The hierarchical organization of data on a pod also leads to data separation between applications. We see this with e.g. Digita <a href="">TODO::source</a> providing a separate container for each app, in the same way that the <code>Program Files</code> folder provides a location for applications to store data. While this mitigates issues of overwriting data, and adds implicit context to data based on its location (at least for the application managing a certain data space), this comes at the cost of data discovery and integration <a href="">TODO:: what more?</a>.</p>

      <h4 id="ldp-as-a-meta-api">LDP as a meta-API</h4>
      <p>We argue that the Linked Data Platform interface is not an API, but a meta-API that can organize data in an infinite amount of ways. In the current environment, applications are forced to make local assumptions, and create application-specific API’s on the Solid data pods through localized assumptions that do not hold for the ecosystem. This comes at the cost of data discovery and interoperability with different applications that do not share the same assumptions.</p>

      <h3 id="api-integration-versus-data-integration">API-integration versus data-integration</h3>

      <p>As the goal for interoperability of online data spaces is to move from the paradigm of API integration to mode data integration centered approaches of data publishing, we see that Linked Data Platform in it’s current state creates API integration issues for applications through localized assumptions in data organization and format / shape <a href="">TODO:: maybe also make the point of format / shape integration a bit more</a>.</p>

      <p>The original paper proposes a solution for data discovery through providing a SPARQL interface that runs on top of the data organized in the Linked Data Platform, where every resource serves as its own SPARQL endpoint (https://github.com/nodeSolidServer/node-solid-server/issues/962) which has since been removed from the spec -&gt; this was no solution after all so maybe this should be casually mentioned as a sidenote?</p>

      <!-- 

As a consequence of these decisions, using the Linked Data Platform interface, reading this contact data requires the knowledge of where the data is stored, and the formatting in which the data is stored to work with the data.

As a consequence of using LDP for the organization of resources on a data pod, the main discovery mechanism over this interface is link traversal through the LDP interface.
This is however a limited approach, as in case an agent tries to retrieve information stored in a public resource at at `&lt;pod_uri&gt;/private/public`, where the parent container `&lt;pod_uri&gt;/private/` is set to be private, the resource cannot be discovered unless the exact URI can be discovered through another means.

In their "extensions to LDP" part of the paper, they propose the "PUT" extension to LDP, with the example of a calendar application
that uses a URI path structure based on dates (i.e., /2016/05/01/event1). A PUT request is to create a new resource called event1,
as well as the missing month (i.e., 05) and day (i.e., 01) containers under /2016.
Here we see again the reliance on the LDP bias (using the slash semantics as semantic information over the stored data instead of explicitly tagging the data with the information), that leads to assumptions being required to discover the data.

The complex data retrieval proposed through SPARQL mentions that optionally a SPARQL endpoint can be provided on a data pod, enabling more complex data queries from a pod, where rdf-resources and metadata for non-rdf resources can be exposed over the interface.
This is to address shortcomings in the LDP interface of not being able to express complex data retrieval operations such as filtering and aggregation. Also proposed here is that pod servers may be responsible for evaluating queries spanning multiple pods by forwarding requests for additional data to other pod servers.

In their related work, it states:
Solid has a strong focus on decoupling data from
applications and in addition ensuring that applications have a simple, generic
and well defined way to access the data stored in the users’ pods.




In Section 5, the paper presents the POD Management system. It defines that pods use LDP to organize data in containers that group resources with every resource and container having their own URI. A pod server should support 
- LDP
- patching (N3-patch, former SPARQL update)
- access control lists (ACL), potentially to be updated to access control policies (ACP).
- live updates
- optionally SPARQL

They advise storage mechanisms for RDF data to use triple stores to facilitate querying.

From all this information, we infer that their approach is focused on data discovery and querying happening mainly over a SPARQL interface that has a full index of all data that is available to the agent querying over the pod and can fulfill these requirements on the server side.



### LDP as an API
Additionally, we also argue that LDP is not an API: it’s a meta-API. 
There are still an infinite amount of ways to expose knowledge over LDP. 
We notice existing work and apps get this wrong[TODO::cite]().


Because of this, we see that the promise of Solid moving the equation from API-integration to data-integration does not hold.
As LDP cannot be viewed as a simple API, the problem of integrating different API's to access data from different sources 
has been translated into requiring knowledge of different writing / storage methods to access data stored on different pods by different applications,
leading to a different kind of API integration, without providing the data-integration that was promised. -->

      <!-- 


------------------------------------------------------------------




A disconnect exists between the practical notion of a Pod and the protocol that provides access to its data, creating confusion as to what exactly a Pod is and how it relates to the technical specifications.

- LDP creates biases in the stored data?
- data integration issues w LDP?


- spec updates evolved the understanding of Solid pods
- the technical specifications put limits on the way data can be interacted with
- to attain the goal of replacing the API integration with data integration, have to work around the limitations of LDP or build alternative interfaces on top.




The current state of LDP makes us think of pods as collections of Linked Data Documents

We see a fundamental mismatch with usage.
We see different apps making local assumptions and optimizations that do not hold for the ecosystem and essentially because of ACL reasons

LDP creates a BIAS in the stored data? e.g. data has to be grouped at a certain location in a resource?
Also the notion that LDP is not an API. It’s a meta-API; there are still infinity ways to expose knowledge through LDP. So existing work and apps get this wrong.

-> The promise of data integration instead of API integration is not satisfied? - This was a point we came up with, however this can be (kinda) solved in the tooling used so ?
-> ...

The Mansouroriginal Solid paper already alluded to shortcomings of the LDP interface (globbing, a separate SPARQL interface for RDF data / metadata)
-> And we will make the argument / take the position that it is more fundamental, that LDP is the problem/limitation rather than the solution. We reframe by seeing one LDP API (there are multiple!) as a possible view on the Pod, which fundamentally is a KG.

      <p>As the current state of Solid leads towards the notion that a Solid pod is</p>

      <h3 id="permissioned-knowledge-graphs">Permissioned Knowledge Graphs</h3>
      <p>With the goal in mind of separating the data and applications, we propose the perspective of Solid as a permissioned knowledge graph.</p>

      <p>Note that where permissioned knowledge graph, we understand a knowledge graph that can assign permissions for any data quads contained in the knowledge graph. We see the permissions set here as a proxy for policy-based authorization for data, where policies can dynamically describe permissions over data <a href="">TODO:: redo this</a>.</p>

      <p>in our perspective is a Knowledge Graph where any collection of data can be grouped under a specific set of user permissions or policies.</p>

      <h3 id="api-integration">API integration</h3>
      <p>A consequence of an ecosystem where knowledge graphs can be exposed over the Web over multiple interfaces, is that this brings us back to the problem of interface-integration.</p>

      <p>For this perspective to work, we must strive to transition from an ecosystem of API integration towards an ecosystem of data integration.</p>

      <p>We argue that the use of Linked Data Platform as an organizational structure for data on a Solid pod relies too much on applications creating localized assumptions and optimizations for the structuring of their data that do not hold for the ecosystem, leading to applications requiring to do API integration on top of these structures, where semantics of the data may encoded and lost in this structuring instead of the data itself.</p>

      <p>Where assumptions are currently contained in the API used to organize the data on a data pod, we need to move these assumptions to the data and explicitly encode them into the semantics of the data.</p>

      <p>In the perspective as a pod being a permissioned Knowledge Graph that can be exposed over a multitude of APIs, we argue that exposing data over well-defined APIs can alleviate API integration problems.
<a href="">TODO:: HOWW???</a></p>

      <h3 id="interface-building-blocks">Interface building blocks</h3>

      <p>In this context, we can view the current state of Solid as pods that expose their internal knowledge graph over building blocks for authorization (WAC / ACP), data management and querying (LDP) and authentication (Solid-OIDC).
In this context, interface building blocks in the ecosystem should try to be minimally interdependent, to promote reuse over multiple interfaces for other components of Solid.</p>

      <p>As a practical example, where the original paper advertised SPARQL as a possible interface to optimize querying on top of the Linked Data Platform data management layer <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]</span>, we propose that a SPARQL endpoint may serve as a querying and data management interface on top of the knowledge graph, requiring new building blocks to be researched for authorization over such an interface.</p>

      <hr />

      <p>With this work, we propose the view of Solid as being data and application independent.</p>

      <p>With this work, we argue that it is not per se the interface of Linked Data Platform that is the cause of issues, but the notion that a Solid pod must adhere to the notion of being an online data space that organizes data as resources over a Linked Data Platform interface.
We pose that the assumptions described above that stem from the use of this organizational structure and the limitations it poses on the data it stores.</p>

      <p>We propose the vision of Solid as a platform serving data pods that organize data as a Knowledge Graph <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-3">3</a>]</span> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-4">4</a>]</span>.</p>

      <p>A network of Solid pods can be seen as a decentralized knowledge graph.</p>

      <p>If a pod can be seen as a Knowledge graph, exposing the contained knowledge can take many forms, as knowledge graphs traditionally have supported multiple interfaces to add, manage and query data <a href="">TODO::sources</a>.</p>

      <p>Say something about integrating interfaces for authorization, data management and querying as building blocks in the ecosystem.</p>

      <p>In this vision, a pod can be considered a permissioned, hybrid Knowledge graph that can be accessed through various Web APIs.</p>

      <!-- 

In the original paper for Solid, there was alluded on exposing all data over a SPARQL endpoint

Wat is solid?
- is het een set van protocols?
- is het een concept geimplementeerd met een set protocols?


Solutions can be found through:

extensions to the LDP interface:
- in spec 
- out of spec client managed?
- out of spec client sided?




### Authorization

- Resources are a straightforward way of combining data triples for authorization purposes.
- autorization systems can be adapted to work on a triple basis OR
- other ways of combining triples in resources can be used that do not include LDP biases (slash semantics)

      <h2 property="schema:name">Comparison</h2>

      <p>In this section, we examine possible interpretations of the technological underpinnings, and compared them from the viewpoints of storage, publication and query.</p>

      <p>In this step, we compare the frameworks of thinking about Solid as a collection of resources exposed over Linked Data Platform, compared to Solid as a Knowledge Graph exposed over a [meta-]model-based interfaces (SPARQL, TPF, …).</p>

      <h3 id="storing-events-on-a-pod">Storing events on a Pod</h3>
      <p>A first concrete example we can give is the example of storing events on a Solid pod.
Events are a wide-spread</p>

      <p>We will make this comparison based on the aspects of storage of the data on the pod server, the publication of the data over the Web, and querying of data over the interface.</p>

      <h4 id="storage">Storage</h4>

      <h4 id="publication">Publication</h4>

      <h4 id="query">Query</h4>

      <p><strong>queries and APIs are separate concepts</strong></p>

      <h3 id="comparing-interfaces">Comparing interfaces</h3>
      <p>A common misconception is that a server interface should be identical to the client interface <a href="">TODO::cite and word according to Ruben blog</a>. 
Interfaces however can be abstracted away in a proxy (A web page abstracting an SQL interface in filters), or on the client (Comunica abstracting away a TPF server as SPARQL)<a href="">TODO::cite</a>.</p>

      <p>For decentralized networks of data sources such as the Solid ecosystem, these abstractions will mainly be the building blocks for applications to work with data stored on the pods.</p>

      <p>We pose that the interface exposing the server Knowledge Graph influences the possibilities and biases for abstractions created over them.
As the Linked Data Platform allows data to be retrieved by retrieving the resources present in the containers and resources advertised by the main index <a href="">TODO:: wording??</a>, consequences of the interface such as public resources in private containers not being discoverable through link traversal of the LDP index will limit the abstractions that can be created over the interface.</p>

      <p>Where initiatives such as the Solid Interoperability Specification <a href="">TODO::cite</a> work to provide answers for these use-cases, they are bound to the organization of data on a pod imposed by the Linked Data Platform specification.</p>

      <h3 id="data-storage-comparison">Data storage comparison</h3>
      <p>Different interfaces exposing data of a knowledge graph may require different storage solutions to access the underlying data.
Note that again here building blocks providing conversions for different interfaces on specific storage mechanisms may be implemented.</p>

      <h4 id="linked-data-platform-interfaces">Linked data platform interfaces</h4>
      <p>can use multiple approaches for data storage. The original Solid introduction paper <a href="">TODO::cite</a> proposed a file-based backend for the storage of non-rdf resources, where rdf resources were stored in a file-based or graph-based system dependent on the optional support for SPARQL over the resources in the pod.</p>

      <h4 id="meta-model-based-interfaces">[meta-]model-based interfaces</h4>
      <p>may require more elaborate back-end support depending on the interface exposed. As interfaces such as SPARQL and TPF interfaces rely mostly on an indexed data graph storage mechanisms<a href="">TODO:: …</a>, 
Support for non-rdf resources must always be taken into account, requiring some sort of organizational structure for these resources to be setup.</p>

      <h3 id="data-publication-comparison">Data publication comparison</h3>

As data discovery is hindered by local assumptions made by applications in the organization of data and their shape, either knowledge about the organization of data, or brute forcing of the available resources is required to discover and retrieve data relevant to a query.
The inclusion of optional SPARQL support in the first iterations of the Solid specification <a href="">TODO::cite</a> supports this.</p>

Assumptions on the shape of data contained in the internal knowledge graph still provide the same challenges, but the organizational structure of data should be abstracted away for clients working with and querying the data.</p>

      <h2 property="schema:name">Conclusion</h2>

      <p>In this work, we proposed the perspective of viewing the Solid pod as a permissioned Knowledge Graph. 
While this perspective does not in itself solve the existing issues with longevity of application interoperability in the Solid ecosystem, it provides a framework that can be used to tackle the present challenges in a way that is more dependent on the data and less dependent on the interfaces used to expose the data over the Web</p>

      <p>Where the current state of Solid as a datastore organized according to its Linked Data Platform interface limits the innovation surface through applications creating localized assumptions,</p>

      <p>We believe this perspective provides the required framing for Solid to fully take the next step from being an ecosystem still centered around API integration through localized assumptions creating application specific interfaces through data organization over LDP, towards an ecosystem centered around data integration over well-defined interfaces  <a href="">TODO:: this and more</a>.</p>

      <p>With this work, we do not propose any specific takeaway as to which interfaces may optimize the current problems of data shape and organization when building applications on top of Solid, but want to provide a framework with which these problems can be tackled in a way that is not restricted to only what the LDP interface allows.</p>

      <!-- -------------------

The insights proposed in this work are crucial to eliminate 
the dependency of Solid apps on concrete APIs.
Local assumptions about the shape and organization of data creating localized APIs for applications over the Linked Data Platform interface exposed by Solid data pods provide local optimizations for data discovery, querying performance and more, but hurt the ecosystem as a whole, as assumptions and biases in the organization and discovery of data are not shared across the ecosystem.

The framing of Solid pods as a Knowledge Graph exposed over a multitude of APIs contrary to a data source organized using the Linked Data Platform specification enables us to think more about 
with the goal of reducing local assumptions and optimizations in apps for reasons of longevity. The API over which data is exposed over the Web is a means to an end, and should not define the platform. -->
