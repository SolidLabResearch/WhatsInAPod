      <!-- Context      -->
      <p>The Solid vision aims to make data independent of applications
through technical specifications,
which detail how to publish and consume permissioned data
across multiple autonomous locations called <q>pods</q>.
<!-- Need         -->
This envisaged independence is not fully realized
by the current document-centric interpretation
wherein a pod is solely a hierarchy of Linked Data documents,
leading to fundamental interoperability and query problems.
Furthermore,
the broader longterm vision for Solid is confounded
with the concrete HTTP interface to pods today,
leading to a narrower solution space for these problems.
<!-- Task         -->
We examined the mismatch between the vision
and the prevalent document-centric interpretation,
and propose a graph-centric interpretation
wherein a pod is fundamentally a knowledge graph.
<!-- Object       -->
In this article,
we contrast the existing and proposed interpretations
in terms of how they realize the Solid vision.
We argue that the knowledge-centric interpretation
improves pod access through different Web APIs
that act as views in a database sense.
<!-- Findings     -->
We show that our zoomed-out interpretation
provides improved opportunities for
storage, publication, and querying of decentralized data
in more flexible and sustainable ways.
<!-- Conclusion   -->
These insights are crucial to reduce
the dependency of Solid apps on implicit API semantics
and local assumptions about the shape and organization of data
and the resulting performance.
<!-- Perspectives -->
The suggested broader interpretation supports Solid with
its evolution into a heterogeneous yet interoperable ecosystem
that accommodates a multitude of read/write data access patterns.</p>

        <h2 property="schema:name">The Solid vision</h2>
        <!-- problem: your data being everywhere, no control very limited interoperability -->
        <p>In the current Web 2.0 ecosystem, 
data ownership and privacy have lost a lot of ground.
Data that is often user generated is stored far away in centralized data silos
and is rarely under direct user control.
In this system, the user neither has the control nor the knowledge to manage how their data is being used in the online space <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]</span>.
<!-- Solid: a vision for a better Web -->
As a response to this, the Solid project was created with the aim of revitalizing the Web <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]</span>.
Where the current system of centralized data silos create an ecosystem of limited integration, availability and innovation,
Tim Berners-Lee’s Solid brings a course correction for the Web.
<!-- ecosystem goal: control over data, interoperability over applications and data -->
Based on the separation of applications and data on the Web,
the vision defines an ecosystem that facilitates the integration of data in applications, while keeping users in direct control of their data <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]</span>.</p>

        <!-- the Solid pod -->
        <p>It introduces the concept of the personal online datastore (pod)
as an online data space for users to control and manage their data on the Web.
These pods form a decentralized Solid ecosystem,
from which applications can directly integrate data from the user Solid pod,
after receiving permission from the user.
This is in contrast to the Web 2.0 architecture where
this data first had to be collected in a centralized location,
after which the platform-specific API had to be integrated,
where all the while user control is at the mercy of the platforms maintaining the data <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]</span>.</p>

        <!-- key for achieving requirement: capture semantics in the data -->
        <p>A key premise for enabling the separation of application and data
is the capture of semantic information in the data itself.
This way, applications can interpret the data without 
requiring specific knowledge encoded in the API over which the data is retrieved. A key driver here is the use of the Resource Description Framework (RDF) <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-3">3</a>]</span>, that provides an infrastructure that enables the capture of this semantic information in the data.
This again stands in contrast to the current Web 2.0 architecture,
where data is often served in formats that require additional semantics to be captured in the documentation of the API.
In this way, the Solid ecosystem marks a transition
from a Web ecosystem of API integration towards
a Web ecosystem centered around data integration <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-4">4</a>]</span>.</p>

        <!-- Now this vision has to be made a reality -->
        <p>From the vision of this ecosystem, 
the challenge now presents itself in how these concepts
can be captured in specifications for the Web.
<!-- The vision is room for many interpretations -->
The proposed vision is is based on broad concepts of interoperability
and user control, so the realization of these concepts can take many different forms.
<!-- there is no authoritative definition -->
As there is no authoritative definition currently available for Solid,
the current initiatives and specifications defining the ecosystem are based on specific interpretations of the Solid vision, and how this can be translated into specifications for the Web.</p>

        <p>In <a href="#documentcentric">Section 2</a>, we describe the interpretation of the Solid vision as a document-centric ecosystem, which is the understanding on which most of the Solid ecosystem is based.
In response to the limitations of this interpretation, 
we present a zoomed-out perspective of a graph-centric interpretation of the Solid ecosystem in <a href="#graphcentric">Section 3</a>.
We describe how this perspective creates a broader base for innovation,
by expanding upon the current state of the ecosystem.
Finally, we present our conclusions in <a href="#conclusion">Section 4</a>.</p>

<div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
        <h2 property="schema:name">The Solid pod as a permissioned document hierarchy</h2>
        <!-- The first interpretation we look at is document-centric. -->
        <p>The envisioned Solid ecosystem in its current state is not well defined, 
and leaves room for different interpretations of the concepts proposed in its vision.
In this section, we present the general understanding of Solid
as a document-centric ecosystem, where the Solid pod is fundamentally understood
as a permissioned document hierarchy.</p>

        <!-- data and files stored as documents on the pod -->
        <p>In this interpretation,
the separation of application and data in the ecosystem is approached 
from the perspective of the Solid pods as a document storage system.
The Solid pod manages all data as documents in a hierarchical structure 
of documents and containers, similar to how a file system organizes data
as files and directories.
Structured data can be stored on the Solid pod by 
converting it to a document in an RDF format,
and storing this document on the Solid pod.
Similarly, other non-RDF documents can be stored in the 
Solid pod document hierarchy.
These documents are then exposed over the Web by the Solid pod.
In this way, the ecosystem achieves the separation of application and data
by storing the application data as (non-)RDF documents on the Solid pod.
User control is maintained on the document level through the management of permissions.
This interpretation of the Solid pod as fundamentally a document hierarchy is
further supported in the concept of <em>slash semantics</em> in the current version of the Solid protocol <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-5">5</a>]</span>,
where the hierarchical relationships between documents and their parent container are 
explicitly defined through the slash (/) characters in their URIs.</p>

        <!-- read/write interface  -->
        <p>The enable users and applications to create and interact with documents stored on the Solid pod,
an adaptation of the Linked Data Platform (LDP) specification <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-6">6</a>]</span> was introduced.
This LDP interface provides a direct view on the document organization
of data on the Solid pod. It defines the terminology of the document structure
as a hierarchy of resources (documents) and containers
and defines the set of valid HTTP(s) operations on this hierarchy.
<!--  The authorization interface -->
Authorization for the Solid pod is similarly based on the document structure of the pod.
There are currently two specifications that are used to manage authorization in the Solid ecosystem:
the Web Access Controls specification (WAC) <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-7">7</a>]</span> 
and the Access Control Policy (ACP) <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-8">8</a>]</span> specification.
Where both specifications differ in their handling of permissions,
both work on top of the notion of the Solid pod being a document hierarchy,
where the granularity through which data sharing can be managed
is defined by the granularity of data in the documents on the Solid pod.
As these documents can be managed by applications, 
the applications indirectly define the granularity 
of control users have over their data.</p>

        <h3 id="interoperability-in-a-document-centric-ecosystem">Interoperability in a document-centric ecosystem</h3>
        <!-- Interoperability problems -->
        <p>The current Solid protocol <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-5">5</a>]</span> provides these specifications as is, 
developers are left with many degrees of freedom in their interpretation 
of how to build on this ecosystem.
Where concepts of interoperability and user control are central in the Solid vision,
their current implementation makes them very dependent
on how applications decide to integrate them.
Where the LDP interface of a Solid pod 
enables some forms of interoperability,
applications are free to use it
as a remote document management system.
Similarly, the authorization interfaces 
enable users to manage the permissions,
but in a way that is limited to how applications
store their data as documents on the pod.</p>

        <!-- This proposes Solid as a document-centric ecosystem. -->
        <p>In a practical example, we examine a set of problems 
faced by two applications  that manage contact information 
in an RDF format on the user Solid pod.</p>

        <!-- hierarchy mismatch -->
        <p>(i) Both applications can make totally different assumptions 
on how they structure their contact data as documents in the pod hierarchy.
This can results in both applications not being aware of 
the others data being available on the pod.
Additionally, even if they scout the pod for additional data, 
the way the applications structure their contact information entries
as documents on the pod may not conform to the assumptions made by 
other applications in the ecosystem.
The document hierarchy does not inherently provide interoperability
of data of applications.
This requires either additional interfaces and agreements
or a different interpretation of the documents by applications.
<!-- writing same location --></p>

        <p>(ii) Issues arise when both applications 
want to write to the same location in the document hierarchy.
Where storing contact information in a <code>/contacts/</code> container 
on the pod makes sense, this can create problems 
where different applications may overwrite data of other applications.
Assumptions on the structuring of contact information 
can also become problematic, as application storage locations
can overlap and documents written to containers used by other applications
may break assumptions and crash applications.
<!-- permission management --></p>

        <p>(iii) The permission management system may cause wrong assumptions by applications.
As permissions are directly tied to specific documents in the hierarchy,
they limit the granularity of control that users have.
One application may try to optimize this, 
by storing their data in small resources 
that can be individually permissioned.
The other application may decide to write 
their contact information as just 
one single resource on the pod.
As assumptions here do not match,
when sharing contact information with other applications,
the user now either has granular control, 
or it has to give access to all the information of a contact,
depending on the application that wrote the data.
Similarly, applications sharing the data may assume 
that contact information is stored in a granular way,
and may wrongly share contact information that 
has all the information visible because of 
wrong assumptions on the data structuring.
These assumptions limit user control over their data
and problems in interoperability with other applications.</p>

        <p>We see that in the above ecosystem, 
defined by the interpretation of Solid as a document-centric ecosystem,
interoperability still faces a lot of hurdles as
problems arise from assumptions made by applications.
It limits the innovations surface
to the capabilities of the document hierarchy
of its Solid pods.</p>

        <h3 id="a-distilled-knowledge-graph-interpretation">A distilled knowledge graph interpretation</h3>
        <!-- The document-centric vision as a KG -->
        <p>To improve upon these problems, 
we see attempts at reconciling the document hierarchy
of the Solid pod with the interpretation as a knowledge graph.
Already in the early iterations of the Solid protocol,
the shortcomings of the LDP interface in terms of 
querying were already mentioned <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]</span>.
To combat this, extensions to the LDP specification were proposed,
and an optional SPARQL interface could be provided
by the Solid pod to enable more complex data retrieval.
More recently, the Enterprise Solid Server implementation by Inrupt 
also started providing an optional QPF-endpoint interface
over the documents in their Solid pods. <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-9">9</a>]</span>. 
In this perspective of the Solid pod document hierarchy
as a knowledge graph, the document organization is no longer
a limiting factor for interoperability.
Applications can query directly on the (RDF) data that is present
in these documents, even though this data may be spread across 
hundreds of documents with different organizations of data in the pod.
This perspective of a Solid pod as a knowledge graph is also 
not limited to the server, as this distillation process
from document hierarchy to knowledge graph
can happen fully on the client side over the LDP interface.</p>

        <!-- Still has problems -->
        <p>However, even with this perspective on the Solid pod, 
where the document organization of the Solid pod is ignored,
we still run into its limitations:
(i) The problem of the organization of data
is removed, but other applications coding assumptions against the 
document hierarchy are still limited in interoperability, 
and do not share the incentive to write rich semantic data to the pod.
(ii) Writing data is still constrained to the document hierarchy,
as all data must be stored in the context of a document on the pod.
This maintains the problems of writing to common
documents and containers.
(iii) The distillation process from document hierarchy to knowledge graph
is open to client interpretation, and may be limited by client understanding
or include interface-specific information such as document last modified information.
(iv) The management of permissions is still
tied to the document hierarchy of the Solid pod, and cannot be
defined in terms of the individual statements in the data.</p>

        <p>Where the current innovation surface for the Solid ecosystem is far from reached,
we already feel the constraints imposed by the document hierarchy limiting the options.
Even in its current small scale, 
the ecosystem is limited in interoperability 
and user control of their data.
New innovations in the ecosystem
such as the application interoperability specification <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-10">10</a>]</span>
and research in the possibility for GDPR compliance <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-11">11</a>]</span>
are limited by the imposed document structure,
and have to work around these limitations.</p>

        <p>Because of this, we feel that a shift in perspective is necessary 
for the Solid ecosystem to evolve in a way that promotes longevity 
in their solutions, and a way that maximizes the innovations 
we can build on the ecosystem.</p>

<div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
        <h2 property="schema:name">The Solid pod as a permissioned Knowledge Graph</h2>
        <p>In the previous section, we outlined the current interpretation 
of Solid as a document-centric ecosystem, where the Solid pod takes the role 
of a permissioned document hierarchy. We demonstrated that even when querying
the Solid pod as a Knowledge graph, interoperability in the ecosystem is still
constrained by its document-centric interpretation.</p>

        <p>Where an ecosystem built on the sharing of documents on the Web
provides a limited surface for innovation,
an ecosystem built on the sharing of data,
not limited to a specific document hierarchy
provides more opportunities for innovation.</p>

        <p>This leads us to propose the definition of the Solid pod as <em>fundamentally being a permissioned, hybrid knowledge graph, exposed through Web APIs</em>.
This understanding of the Solid pod shifts the premise from data contained in documents to documents built on top of data.</p>

        <!-- permissioned -->
        <p>With <em>permissioned</em>, we express the ability to manage permissions over any individual nodes and relation in the knowledge graph.
Note that we use this term to lean close to the current proposition for user control in Solid, 
but that we recognize the term <em>parameterized</em> as a potential evolution, where next to only user permissions,
any number of parameters can be retained for the individual nodes and relations in the knowledge graph. 
<!-- hybdid -->
<em>hybrid</em> expresses the ability of the knowledge graph to store any kind of data as nodes in the knowledge graph 
in the form of blobs, for which metadata can be maintained in the knowledge graph.
<!-- knowledge grap -->
For the term <em>knowledge graph</em>, 
we adopt the definition proposed in <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-12">12</a>]</span>:
“<em>Herein we adopt an inclusive definition, 
where we view a knowledge graph as a graph of data intended to accumulate and convey knowledge of the real world,
whose nodes represent entities of interest and whose edges represent relations between these entities. 
The graph of data (aka data graph) conforms to a graph-based data model, 
which may be a directed edge-labelled graph, a property graph, etc.</em>”
<!-- Web APIs -->
And finally, the definition states that this knowledge graph can be exposed using <em>any suitable Web API</em>,
so that the possibilities of the ecosystem are not constrained by the capabilities of any specific API.</p>

        <h3 id="a-fundamentally-different-interpretation">A fundamentally different interpretation</h3>
        <!-- The interpretation -->
        <p>With the proposed definition, we want to provide a zoomed-out perspective on the current state of the Solid ecosystem.
Where in the current ecosystem, the document hierarchy of a Solid pod is constraining factor,
it can instead be perceived as one of the many possibilities
of representing the internal knowledge graph of a Solid pod.
By shifting the interpretation of the document hierarchy from the authoritative source
to a representation on the data in the Solid pod, we can construct any number of hierarchies 
over the Pod knowledge graph.
These can be built on the Solid pod server, or can be created at the client
over the APIs that are exposed by the Solid pod.</p>

        <!-- The current Solid protocol as a KG -->
        <p>Note that this interpretation of the ecosystem 
does not invalidate the current Solid protocol.
It however changes the implication
of the exposed LDP interface of the Solid pod
from maintaining the Solid pod document hierarchy,
to being a possible representation of the internal data state.
Where the current ecosystem restricts permissions to the document
hierarchy of the LDP interface, the zoomed-out perspective
enables the construction of the document hierarchy based on 
the permissions set in the pod knowledge graph.
By only including data in documents for which permissions are set,
we can reuse the current protocols 
but shift their position in the ecosystem to better 
reflect their function as an interface on the data in the Solid pod.</p>

        <p>However, not all translations are seamless.
Where a knowledge graph can be distilled from a document hierarchy,
the inverse operation require additional semantics,
such as the use of named graphs in the data of the pod knowledge graph,
as is currently proposed for the optional query interfaces of the Solid pods.
Similarly, the current authorization protocols in their current state can be reused
only to set permissions for the subset of data in a document for which this is allowed,
as they cannot be used to manage permissions for single data entries in a document.</p>

        <!-- conclusion -->
        <p>The attempts to improve queries on top 
of the current Solid ecosystem 
through optional SPARQL <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]</span> 
or QPF <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-9">9</a>]</span> interfaces,
demonstrates the requirement
for a knowledge-graph interpretation
of the Solid pod in at least a query perspective.
We conclude that where the current Solid protocol,
built on the LDP and WAC/ACP specifications,
tries to emulate a permissioned knowledge graph,
it falls short of the intended goals.
Through the zoomed-out perspective of the Solid pod
as a knowledge graph exposed over Web APIs, 
we shift the focus back to the data itself
and reframe the interfaces as a means to an end.</p>

        <!-- Make point that a document FUNDAMENTALLY is built on application assumptions -->

        <!-- Synthese: perfect naast elkaar leven -->

        <!-- Reflection on the current ecosystem -->
        <p>In the current Solid ecosystem,
the common interpretation of the ecosystem has moved towards a document-centric vision,
where the Linked Data Platform interface is central to the notion of what constitutes a Solid pod.
It creates a limited space for innovation,
by constraining the interoperability and user control of data
to the document hierarchy on the Solid pod.</p>

        <!-- With this work, we propose perspective of Solid as ...  -->
        <p>With this work, we proposed the interpretation of the Solid pod 
being fundamentally a permissioned, hybrid knowledge graph, 
exposed through Web APIs.</p>

        <!-- what does it do -->
        <p>Through this zoomed-out perspective of the ecosystem
we define an innovation space that is not constrained 
by specific protocols, but that can build upon the current 
protocols to provide more general solutions for the 
challenges faced by the ecosystem.</p>

        <!-- how does it build -->
        <p>By reframing the current protocols for managing data (LDP) 
and authorization (WAC/ACP) into interfaces exposing an 
internal knowledge graph of the Solid pod,
we can re-use these protocols in a new setting.
By shifting the understanding from a data graph 
created over a document system,
towards a document system,
dynamically created over a data graph,
we can fundamentally shift the understanding of the ecosystem
towards a graph-centric interpretation.</p>

        <p>Though we do not propose any specific takeaway as to which interfaces 
may be better suited to provide solutions in the current ecosystem,
we invite the reader to think along in how this zoomed-out perspective of the ecosystem
can lead to better solutions to the problems faced by the ecosystem today.</p>

        <p><br />
What’s in a pod? <em>It’s in the eye of the beholder</em>, not in the constraints of the interface.</p>
