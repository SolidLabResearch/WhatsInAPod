      <!-- Context      -->
      <p>The Solid vision aims to make data independent of applications
through technical specifications,
which detail how to publish and consume permissioned data
across multiple autonomous locations called <q>pods</q>.
<!-- Need         -->
The current document-centric interpretation of Solid,
wherein a pod is solely a hierarchy of Linked Data documents,
cannot fully realize this envisaged independence.
Applications are left to define their own APIs
within the Solid Protocol,
which leads to fundamental interoperability problems
and the need for associated workarounds.
The broader longterm vision for Solid is confounded
with the concrete HTTP interface to pods today,
leading to a narrower solution space to address these core issues.
<!-- Task         -->
We examine the mismatch between the vision
and the prevalent document-centric interpretation,
and propose a reconciliatory graph-centric interpretation
wherein a pod is fundamentally a knowledge graph.
<!-- Object       -->
In this article,
we contrast the existing and proposed interpretations
in terms of how they support the Solid vision.
We argue that the knowledge-centric interpretation
can improve pod access through different Web APIs
that act as views in a database sense.
<!-- Findings     -->
We show that our zoomed-out interpretation
provides improved opportunities for
storage, publication, and querying of decentralized data
in more flexible and sustainable ways.
<!-- Conclusion   -->
These insights are crucial to reduce
the dependency of Solid apps on implicit API semantics
and local assumptions about the shape and organization of data
and the resulting performance.
<!-- Perspectives -->
The suggested broader interpretation can guide Solid
through its evolution into a heterogeneous yet interoperable ecosystem
that accommodates a multitude of read/write data access patterns.</p>

        <!-- problem: your data being everywhere, no control very limited interoperability -->
        <p>On today’s Web,
data privacy and control have lost ground.
User-generated data is stored in centralized data silos,
in which people have neither the control nor the knowledge to manage how their data is being used <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]</span>.
<!-- Solid: a vision for a better Web -->
As a response to this, the Solid project was created with the aim of revitalizing the Web <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]</span>.
Where the current system of centralized data silos create an ecosystem of limited integration, availability and innovation,
Solid brings a course correction for the Web.
<!-- ecosystem goal: control over data, interoperability over applications and data -->
Based on the separation of applications and data on the Web,
the vision defines an ecosystem that facilitates the integration of data in applications, while keeping people in direct control of their data <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]</span>.</p>

        <!-- the Solid pod -->
        <p>Solid introduces the concept of a <em>pod</em>
as an online data space for people to control and manage their data on the Web.
These pods form a decentralized Solid ecosystem,
from which applications can directly integrate data from the user’s Solid pod,
after receiving their permission.
This is in contrast to current Web applications, where
this data first had to be collected in a centralized location,
after which the platform-specific API had to be integrated,
where all the while user control is at the mercy of the platforms maintaining the data <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]</span>.</p>

        <!-- key for achieving requirement: capture semantics in the data -->
        <p>A precondition to the separation of data and application
is the capture of semantic information in the data itself.
This way, applications can interpret the data without 
requiring specific knowledge encoded in the API over which the data is retrieved. A key driver here is the use of the <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-rdf11-concepts-20140225/">Resource Description Framework (RDF)</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-3">3</a>]</span>, which provides an infrastructure for the capture of this semantic information in the data.
This again stands in contrast to the current Web APIs,
where data is often served in formats that require additional semantics to be captured in the documentation of the API.
In this way, the Solid ecosystem aims to start a transition
from a Web ecosystem of API integration towards
a Web ecosystem centered around data integration <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-4">4</a>]</span>.</p>

        <!-- Now this vision has to be made a reality -->
        <p>Starting from the vision of this ecosystem,
the challenge is to capture its concepts
in specifications for the Web.
<!-- The vision is room for many interpretations -->
The vision is based on broad concepts of interoperability
and user control,
so the realization can take different forms.
<!-- there is no authoritative definition -->
As there is no authoritative definition for Solid,
current initiatives and specifications defining the ecosystem are based on specific interpretations of the Solid vision.</p>

        <p>In <a href="#document-centric"></a>, we describe the interpretation of the Solid vision as a document-centric ecosystem, which is the understanding on which most of the current Solid ecosystem is based.
In response to the limitations of this interpretation, 
we present a zoomed-out perspective of a graph-centric interpretation of the Solid ecosystem in <a href="#graph-centric"></a>.
We describe how this perspective creates a broader base for innovation,
by expanding upon the current state of the ecosystem.</p>

<div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
        <h2 property="schema:name">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Different interpretations of the Solid vision
come with different abilities to support that vision.
The dominant document-centric interpretation,
specified by the <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsSourceDocument" href="https://solidproject.org/TR/2021/protocol-20211217">Solid Protocol</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-5">5</a>]</span>
as an LDP derivative with per-document access control,
has the benefit of being conceptually simple
and hence developer-friendly.
However, we argue in this article that the simplicity
afforded by a hierarchical document collection
stems from shortcuts taken by applications,
which are burrowing their own ad-hoc APIs with implicit semantics
into the container meta-model.
This hinders the Solid promise of data and application independence:
while the data itself contains explicit semantics that can be interpreted by apps,
the organization of that data is such that it its storage and retrieval
necessitates out-of-band contracts between different applications,
resulting in significant app-to-app coupling
and subsequently systematic app breakage when ad-hoc APIs eventually evolve.
Furthermore, we show that the abstraction easily breaks
when apps pursue slightly conflicting goals.</p>

        <p>These issues have so far largely gone unnoticed,
because singular apps do not hit such problems,
and different apps in a small ecosystem
can still coordinate behind the scenes.
However,
an emergence of more Solid apps that need to interoperate
has increased the frequency of such conflicts.
Stopgaps that are being created to address them
unfortunately only prolong unsustainable practices,
as many issues are simply inherent to the implicit semantics within ad-hoc APIs.
Proposals typically focus on making API semantics explicit <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-6">6</a>, <a href="#ref-7">7</a>]</span>,
yet they inevitably inherit the abstraction’s mismatches.
This is why we instead suggest pushing the vision forward
by separating the semantics from the API altogether.</p>

        <p>We observe that the document-centric interpretation
seems to act as a proxy for a more fundamental concept,
namely a permissioned, hybrid knowledge graph
that accommodates data as well as documents.
Our proposed graph-centric interpretation
put this concept at the heart of each pod,
and considers document interfaces such as those that exist today
as specialized views of an underlying richer source of truth.
This affords more flexibility—and hence independence—in
how multiple apps can interact with the same graph data.
Crucially,
this also broadens the solution space
to tackle interoperability challenges.
We are no longer confined to working around inherent LDP-level problems,
but can create solutions at the knowledge graph level
and mint associated API views tailored to the needs and constraints
of specific applications and use cases.
The same app can seamlessly interact
via different read and write interfaces to a pod,
depending on what it is optimizing for.
This also opens the door for authorization
with different granularities beyond the scope of
one specific LDP interface’s document organization.
We thereby shift the understanding
from a data graph instantiated from a document organization,
to a dynamically instantiated document interface over a data graph,
paving the way for fundamentally graph-centric data management within Solid.
Through the zoomed-out perspective of the pod
as a knowledge graph exposed over Web APIs, 
we refocus on the data itself
and reframe the interfaces as means to an end.</p>

        <p>Consequences from interpretation differences are not purely conceptual or theoretical.
For instance,
current implementations of alternative access APIs to pods
are still tainted by the document-centric interpretation.
A concrete consequence manifests itself
in the current <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsEvidence" href="https://docs.inrupt.com/ess/latest/query/qpf-endpoint/">Quad Pattern Fragments API</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-8">8</a>]</span>,
meant to facilitate complex queries over a pod.
This <em>quad-centric</em> API offers pattern-based access to RDF quads,
whose graph component is defined as
the URI where the <em>document-centric</em> API happens to expose them.
Ironically,
the server thereby imposes some of the same LDP constraints and mismatches
on the very API that is supposed to mitigate them.
This happens because the additional API is built on top of the LDP-based API,
which this interpretation considers to <em>be</em> the pod.
In a graph-centric interpretation,
the pod is instead a knowledge graph with multiple APIs as views.
Document URIs are ephemeral artifacts of one particular API
that carry no meaning in the graph,
nor in other views or apps.
Therefore,
a Quad Pattern Fragments API within the graph-centric interpretation
would never use the document URL from another API as fourth quad component.</p>

        <p>We stress that the document-centric as well as the graph-centric interpretation
are supported by the current Solid specifications,
notably the <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsSourceDocument" href="https://solidproject.org/TR/2021/protocol-20211217">Solid Protocol</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-5">5</a>]</span>,
which is a testament to both the orthogonality of the specification
and the vision compatibility of graph-centricity.
Specifically,
the graph-centric interpretation of the Solid vision
still embraces document-based access as a core building block for APIs.
What changes is the role played by the document hierarchy:
rather than the one absolute source of truth of a pod,
we recognize more value in seeing it as one of many views
into a much more elaborate knowledge graph,
for which APIs act as a vessel.
Therefore,
what is in a pod is essentially in the eye of the beholder:
all depends on which view offers the best fit for a specific purpose.</p>
