      <!-- Context      -->
      <p>The Solid vision aims to make data independent of applications
through technical specifications,
which detail how to publish and consume permissioned data
across multiple autonomous locations called <q>pods</q>.
<!-- Need         -->
The current document-centric interpretation of Solid,
wherein a pod is solely a hierarchy of Linked Data documents,
cannot fully realize this envisaged independence,
leading to fundamental interoperability problems
and the need for associated workarounds.
The broader longterm vision for Solid is confounded
with the concrete HTTP interface to pods today,
leading to a narrower solution space to address these core issues.
<!-- Task         -->
We examined the mismatch between the vision
and the prevalent document-centric interpretation,
and propose a reconciliatory graph-centric interpretation
wherein a pod is fundamentally a knowledge graph.
<!-- Object       -->
In this article,
we contrast the existing and proposed interpretations
in terms of how they support the Solid vision.
We argue that the knowledge-centric interpretation
improves pod access through different Web APIs
that act as views in a database sense.
<!-- Findings     -->
We show that our zoomed-out interpretation
provides improved opportunities for
storage, publication, and querying of decentralized data
in more flexible and sustainable ways.
<!-- Conclusion   -->
These insights are crucial to reduce
the dependency of Solid apps on implicit API semantics
and local assumptions about the shape and organization of data
and the resulting performance.
<!-- Perspectives -->
The suggested broader interpretation can guide Solid
through its evolution into a heterogeneous yet interoperable ecosystem
that accommodates a multitude of read/write data access patterns.</p>

        <h2 property="schema:name">The Solid vision</h2>
        <!-- problem: your data being everywhere, no control very limited interoperability -->
        <p>On today’s Web,
data privacy and control have lost a lot of ground.
User-generated data is often stored far away in centralized data silos,
in which people have neither the control nor the knowledge to manage how their data is being used in the online space <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]</span>.
<!-- Solid: a vision for a better Web -->
As a response to this, the Solid project was created with the aim of revitalizing the Web <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]</span>.
Where the current system of centralized data silos create an ecosystem of limited integration, availability and innovation,
Tim Berners-Lee’s Solid brings a course correction for the Web.
<!-- ecosystem goal: control over data, interoperability over applications and data -->
Based on the separation of applications and data on the Web,
the vision defines an ecosystem that facilitates the integration of data in applications, while keeping people in direct control of their data <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]</span>.</p>

        <!-- the Solid pod -->
        <p>Solid introduces the concept of a <em>pod</em>
as an online data space for people to control and manage their data on the Web.
These pods form a decentralized Solid ecosystem,
from which applications can directly integrate data from the user’s Solid pod,
after receiving their permission.
This is in contrast to current Web applications, where
this data first had to be collected in a centralized location,
after which the platform-specific API had to be integrated,
where all the while user control is at the mercy of the platforms maintaining the data <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]</span>.</p>

        <!-- key for achieving requirement: capture semantics in the data -->
        <p>A precondition to the separation of data and application
is the capture of semantic information in the data itself.
This way, applications can interpret the data without 
requiring specific knowledge encoded in the API over which the data is retrieved. A key driver here is the use of the <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-rdf11-concepts-20140225/">Resource Description Framework (RDF)</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-3">3</a>]</span>, which provides an infrastructure for the capture of this semantic information in the data.
This again stands in contrast to the current Web APIs,
where data is often served in formats that require additional semantics to be captured in the documentation of the API.
In this way, the Solid ecosystem aims to start a transition
from a Web ecosystem of API integration towards
a Web ecosystem centered around data integration <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-4">4</a>]</span>.</p>

        <!-- Now this vision has to be made a reality -->
        <p>From the vision of this ecosystem, 
the challenge now presents itself in how these concepts
can be captured in specifications for the Web.
<!-- The vision is room for many interpretations -->
The proposed vision is based on broad concepts of interoperability
and user control, so the realization of these concepts can take many different forms.
<!-- there is no authoritative definition -->
As there is no authoritative definition available for Solid,
current initiatives and specifications defining the ecosystem are based on specific interpretations of the Solid vision.</p>

        <p>In <a href="#documentcentric"></a>, we describe the interpretation of the Solid vision as a document-centric ecosystem, which is the understanding on which most of the current Solid ecosystem is based.
In response to the limitations of this interpretation, 
we present a zoomed-out perspective of a graph-centric interpretation of the Solid ecosystem in <a href="#graphcentric"></a>.
We describe how this perspective creates a broader base for innovation,
by expanding upon the current state of the ecosystem.</p>

      </div>
</section>

  <section id="the-current-document-centric-interpretation" inlist="" rel="schema:hasPart" resource="#the-current-document-centric-interpretation">
<div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
        <h2 property="schema:name">The current document-centric interpretation</h2>
        <!-- The first interpretation we look at is document-centric. -->
        <p>The envisioned Solid ecosystem in its current state is not well defined, 
leaving room for different interpretations of the proposed concepts.
The currently prevailing understanding of Solid
is that of a <em>document-centric ecosystem</em>,
where a pod is fundamentally interpreted
as a permissioned document hierarchy.
The separation of application and data is approached
from the perspective of Solid pods as a document storage system.
The pod manages all data as documents in a hierarchical structure of containers,
similar to how a file system organizes data
as files and directories.</p>

        <p>Structured data is exposed over HTTP as a document with an RDF representation,
which is typically (although not observably through the HTTP interface)
materialized next to non-RDF resources in a document-oriented backend.
The separation of application and data is realized
by storing data within documents in the pod
rather than in the application itself.
User control is maintained on via document-level permission management.
This document-centric interpretation is
further supported via the concept of <em>slash semantics</em>
in the current version of the <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsSourceDocument" href="https://solidproject.org/TR/2021/protocol-20211217">Solid Protocol</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-5">5</a>]</span>,
where the hierarchical relationships between documents and their parent container are 
explicitly defined through slash characters (<code>/</code>) in their URLs.</p>

        <!-- read/write interface  -->
        <p>The enable users and applications to create and interact with documents stored on the Solid pod,
an adaptation of the <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsSourceDocument" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/"><em>Linked Data Platform (LDP) specification</em></a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-6">6</a>]</span> was derived.
LDP is a protocol that enables defining custom document interfaces,
and serves to provide a direct view on the document organization of a Solid pod.
<!--  The authorization interface -->
Authorization is similarly based on the document structure,
and can be realized via
<a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsSourceDocument" href="https://solid.github.io/web-access-control-spec/"><em>Web Access Controls (WAC)</em></a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-7">7</a>]</span> 
or <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsSourceDocument" href="https://solid.github.io/authorization-panel/acp-specification/"><em>Access Control Policy (ACP)</em></a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-8">8</a>]</span>.
Whereas these specifications differ in their handling of permissions,
both assume the notion of the pod as a document hierarchy,
where the granularity through which data sharing can be managed
is defined by the granularity of data in the documents on the Solid pod.</p>

        <h3 id="interoperability-challenges">Interoperability challenges</h3>
        <!-- Interoperability problems -->
        <p>Since the Solid protocol does not constrain the API exposed through LDP,
app developers are left with many degrees of freedom.
This makes the Solid vision’s central concepts of interoperability and control
dependent on application-specific choices.</p>

        <!-- This proposes Solid as a document-centric ecosystem. -->
        <p>Let us examine conflicts that arise
via three common applications that use similar data
but impose different demands on an LDP interface to that data.
The first is an <strong>address book app</strong>
where the user views and edits
all details of their professional contacts.
The second is a <strong>birthday app</strong>,
which lets the user message people on their birthday.
The third is a <strong>dating app</strong>
that allows the user to interact with people
on a photo and first-name basis.
To exemplify real-world consequences,
we strive to give each app minimal access.
The address book can access all personal fields for non-dating contacts;
the birthday app can see name, birthdate, and messaging details of all contacts;
the dating app can access first name, profile picture,
and messaging details of dating contacts.
We use these to illustrate that even simple examples
can easily expose four kinds of mismatches
within a interpretation where the pod <em>is</em> the document hierarchy:</p>

        <!-- hierarchy mismatch -->
        <p><strong>(i) Internal API modeling mismatches.</strong>
Each app needs to define a single consistent hierarchy
to serialize their data,
which does not reflect the complex nature of real-world organization.
For instance,
the contact app could organize people in categories
such as <code>/contacts/work/</code> and <code>/contacts/sports/</code>,
which leads to duplication when your colleague
is also a member of your amateur football team.
Hierarchical organizations are thus constrained
in their ability to uniquely represent the real world.</p>

        <p><strong>(ii) External API modeling mismatches.</strong>
Apps can make vastly different assumptions 
on how they structure contact data.
The document hierarchy does not inherently provide interoperability;
this requires either additional interfaces and agreements
or a different interpretation of the documents by applications.
The contacts and birthday apps would need
to store information in the same <code>/contacts/</code> container.
Failure to do so would result in apps not being aware of 
the others’ data being available on the pod.
Even if they do,
their preferences regarding the organization of that container might vary.
Different contexts might form the basis for address book organization,
whereas the birthday app does not understand
the difference between a colleague or family member,
and would hence not know where to write.
It might instead organize people by birthday month,
which in turn would be nonsensical to the address book.</p>

        <p><strong>(iii) Permission mismatches.</strong>
The coupling of permissions to document organization
provides the main mechanism of control,
but it is based on the flawed assumption
that only one hierarchy exists to organize information.
As permissions are directly tied to specific documents in the hierarchy,
the granularity of user control is limited.
For the birthday and dating apps,
address information should <em>not</em> be part of the contact document;
in contrast, the contacts app
would put all contact details into a single document
to apply the same permissioning rules.
As the assumptions do not match,
the user becomes torn between overly granular control
or giving apps too much access.
Similarly, applications sharing the data may assume 
that contact fields are stored in a granular way,
and may wrongly share too many contact details.</p>

        <p><strong>(iv) Local optimization mismatches.</strong>
Current Solid apps are commonly seen
trying to optimize the document-based API
for access patterns that are specific to their needs.
For the contacts app,
one document per contact might be beneficial.
The birthday app might find it more optimal
to have a single document with names and birthdates,
or perhaps one document per month.
The dating app might want the document per contact
to include all exchanged messages,
which would be unnecessary overhead for the other apps.</p>

        <h3 id="distilled-knowledge-graph-interpretation">Distilled knowledge graph interpretation</h3>
        <!-- The document-centric vision as a KG -->
        <p>To improve upon these problems, 
we see attempts at reconciling the document hierarchy
of the Solid pod with the interpretation as a knowledge graph.
Already in the early iterations of the Solid protocol,
the shortcomings of the LDP interface in terms of 
querying were already mentioned <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]</span>.
To combat this, extensions to the LDP specification were proposed,
and an optional SPARQL interface could be provided
by the Solid pod to enable more complex data retrieval.
More recently, the Enterprise Solid Server implementation by Inrupt 
also started providing an optional QPF-endpoint interface
over the documents in their Solid pods. <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-9">9</a>]</span>. 
In this perspective of the Solid pod document hierarchy
as a knowledge graph, the document organization is no longer
a limiting factor for interoperability.
Applications can query directly on the (RDF) data that is present
in these documents, even though this data may be spread across 
hundreds of documents with different organizations of data in the pod.
This perspective of a Solid pod as a knowledge graph is also 
not limited to the server, as this distillation process
from document hierarchy to knowledge graph
can happen fully on the client side over the LDP interface.</p>

        <!-- Still has problems -->
        <p>However, even with this perspective on the Solid pod, 
where the document organization of the Solid pod is ignored,
we still run into its limitations:
(i) The problem of the organization of data
is removed, but other applications coding assumptions against the 
document hierarchy are still limited in interoperability, 
and do not share the incentive to write rich semantic data to the pod.
(ii) Writing data is still constrained to the document hierarchy,
as all data must be stored in the context of a document on the pod.
This maintains the problems of writing to common
documents and containers.
(iii) The distillation process from document hierarchy to knowledge graph
is open to client interpretation, and may be limited by client understanding
or include interface-specific information such as document last modified information.
(iv) The management of permissions is still
tied to the document hierarchy of the Solid pod, and cannot be
defined in terms of the individual statements in the data.</p>

        <p>Where the current innovation surface for the Solid ecosystem is far from reached,
we already feel the constraints imposed by the document hierarchy limiting the options.
Even in its current small scale, 
the ecosystem is limited in interoperability 
and user control of their data.
New innovations in the ecosystem
such as the application interoperability specification <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-10">10</a>]</span>
and research in the possibility for GDPR compliance <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-11">11</a>]</span>
are limited by the imposed document structure,
and have to work around these limitations.</p>

        <p>Because of this, we feel that a shift in perspective is necessary 
for the Solid ecosystem to evolve in a way that promotes longevity 
in their solutions, and a way that maximizes the innovations 
we can build on the ecosystem.</p>

  <section id="the-proposed-graph-centric-interpretation" inlist="" rel="schema:hasPart" resource="#the-proposed-graph-centric-interpretation">
<div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
        <h2 property="schema:name">The proposed graph-centric interpretation</h2>
        <p>In the previous section, we outlined the current interpretation 
of Solid as a document-centric ecosystem, where the Solid pod takes the role 
of a permissioned document hierarchy. We demonstrated that even when querying
the Solid pod as a Knowledge graph, interoperability in the ecosystem is still
constrained by its document-centric interpretation.</p>

        <p>Where an ecosystem built on the sharing of documents on the Web
provides a limited surface for innovation,
an ecosystem built on the sharing of data,
not limited to a specific document hierarchy
provides more opportunities for innovation.</p>

        <p>This leads us to propose the definition of the Solid pod as <em>fundamentally being a permissioned, hybrid knowledge graph, exposed through Web APIs</em>.
This understanding of the Solid pod shifts the premise from data contained in documents to documents built on top of data.</p>

        <!-- permissioned -->
        <p>With <em>permissioned</em>, we express the ability to manage permissions over any individual nodes and relation in the knowledge graph.
Note that we use this term to lean close to the current proposition for user control in Solid, 
but that we recognize the term <em>parameterized</em> as a potential evolution, where next to only user permissions,
any number of parameters can be retained for the individual nodes and relations in the knowledge graph. 
<!-- hybdid -->
<em>hybrid</em> expresses the ability of the knowledge graph to store any kind of data as nodes in the knowledge graph 
in the form of blobs, for which metadata can be maintained in the knowledge graph.
<!-- knowledge grap -->
For the term <em>knowledge graph</em>, 
we adopt the definition proposed in <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-12">12</a>]</span>:
“<em>Herein we adopt an inclusive definition, 
where we view a knowledge graph as a graph of data intended to accumulate and convey knowledge of the real world,
whose nodes represent entities of interest and whose edges represent relations between these entities. 
The graph of data (aka data graph) conforms to a graph-based data model, 
which may be a directed edge-labelled graph, a property graph, etc.</em>”
<!-- Web APIs -->
And finally, the definition states that this knowledge graph can be exposed using <em>any suitable Web API</em>,
so that the possibilities of the ecosystem are not constrained by the capabilities of any specific API.</p>

        <h3 id="a-fundamentally-different-interpretation">A fundamentally different interpretation</h3>
        <!-- The interpretation -->
        <p>With the proposed definition, we want to provide a zoomed-out perspective on the current state of the Solid ecosystem.
Where in the current ecosystem, the document hierarchy of a Solid pod is constraining factor,
it can instead be perceived as one of the many possibilities
of representing the internal knowledge graph of a Solid pod.
By shifting the interpretation of the document hierarchy from the authoritative source
to a representation on the data in the Solid pod, we can construct any number of hierarchies 
over the Pod knowledge graph.
These can be built on the Solid pod server, or can be created at the client
over the APIs that are exposed by the Solid pod.</p>

        <!-- The current Solid protocol as a KG -->
        <p>Note that this interpretation of the ecosystem 
does not invalidate the current Solid protocol.
It however changes the implication
of the exposed LDP interface of the Solid pod
from maintaining the Solid pod document hierarchy,
to being a possible representation of the internal data state.
Where the current ecosystem restricts permissions to the document
hierarchy of the LDP interface, the zoomed-out perspective
enables the construction of the document hierarchy based on 
the permissions set in the pod knowledge graph.
By only including data in documents for which permissions are set,
we can reuse the current protocols 
but shift their position in the ecosystem to better 
reflect their function as an interface on the data in the Solid pod.</p>

        <p>However, not all translations are seamless.
Where a knowledge graph can be distilled from a document hierarchy,
the inverse operation require additional semantics,
such as the use of named graphs in the data of the pod knowledge graph,
as is currently proposed for the optional query interfaces of the Solid pods.
Similarly, the current authorization protocols in their current state can be reused
only to set permissions for the subset of data in a document for which this is allowed,
as they cannot be used to manage permissions for single data entries in a document.</p>

        <!-- conclusion -->
        <p>The attempts to improve queries on top 
of the current Solid ecosystem 
through optional SPARQL <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]</span> 
or QPF <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-9">9</a>]</span> interfaces,
demonstrates the requirement
for a knowledge-graph interpretation
of the Solid pod in at least a query perspective.
We conclude that where the current Solid protocol,
built on the LDP and WAC/ACP specifications,
tries to emulate a permissioned knowledge graph,
it falls short of the intended goals.
Through the zoomed-out perspective of the Solid pod
as a knowledge graph exposed over Web APIs, 
we shift the focus back to the data itself
and reframe the interfaces as a means to an end.</p>

        <!-- Make point that a document FUNDAMENTALLY is built on application assumptions -->

        <!-- Synthese: perfect naast elkaar leven -->

        <!-- Make harsher point maybe -->

        <!-- Mkae point van Comparible on READ - problems of writing and management for data are problematic on document structure -->

<div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
        <h2 property="schema:name">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Different interpretations of the Solid vision
come with different abilities to support that vision.
The dominant document-centric interpretation,
specified by the <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsSourceDocument" href="https://solidproject.org/TR/2021/protocol-20211217">Solid Protocol</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-5">5</a>]</span>
as an LDP derivative with per-document access control,
has the benefit of being conceptually simple
and hence developer-friendly.
However, we argue in this article that the simplicity
afforded by a hierarchical document collection
stems from shortcuts taken by applications,
which burrow their own ad-hoc APIs with implicit semantics
within the LDP container meta-model.
This hinders the Solid promise of data and application independence:
while the data itself contains explicit semantics that can be interpreted by apps,
the organization of that data is such that it its storage and retrieval
necessitates out-of-band contracts between different applications,
resulting in significant app-to-app coupling
and subsequently systematic app breakage when ad-hoc APIs eventually evolve.
Furthermore, we show that the abstraction easily breaks
when apps pursue slightly conflicting goals.</p>

        <p>These issues have so far largely gone unnoticed,
because singular apps do not hit such problems,
and different apps in a small ecosystem
can still coordinate behind the scenes.
However,
an emergence of more Solid apps that need to interoperate
has increased the frequency of such conflicts.
Stopgaps that are being created to address them
unfortunately only prolong unsustainable practices,
as many issues are simply inherent to the implicit semantics within ad-hoc APIs.
Proposals typically focus on making API semantics explicit <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-13">13</a>, <a href="#ref-14">14</a>]</span>,
yet they inevitably inherit the abstraction’s breaking points.
This is why we instead suggest pushing the vision forward
by separating the semantics from the API altogether.</p>

        <p>We observe that the document-centric interpretation
seems to act as a proxy for a more fundamental concept,
namely a permissioned, hybrid knowledge graph
that accommodates data as well as documents.
In our proposed graph-centric interpretation,
document interfaces such as those that exist today
are considered specialized views of an underlying richer source of truth,
affording more flexibility—and hence independence—in
how multiple apps can interact with the same graph data.
Crucially,
this also broadens the solution space for innovation.
We are no longer confined to working around inherent LDP-level problems,
but can create solutions at the knowledge graph level
and mint associated API views tailored to the needs and constraints
of specific applications and use cases.
The same app can seamlessly interact
via different read and write interfaces to a pod,
depending on what it is optimizing for.
This also opens the door for authorization
with different granularities beyond the scope of
one specific LDP interface’s document organization.
We thereby shift the understanding
from a data graph instantiated from a document organization,
to a dynamically instantiated document interface over a data graph,
paving the way for fundamentally graph-centric data management within Solid.</p>

        <p>Importantly,
consequences from this different interpretation are not purely conceptual or theoretical.
For instance,
current implementations of alternative access APIs to pods
are still tainted by the document-centric interpretation.
A concrete consequence manifests itself
in a current <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsEvidence" href="https://docs.inrupt.com/ess/latest/query/qpf-endpoint/"><em>quad-centric</em> API</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-9">9</a>]</span>,
meant to facilitate complex queries over a pod.
The API exposes RDF quads,
whose graph component is the URI
on which they happen to appear in the <em>document</em> API—ironically
imposing some of the same LDP constraints
on an API that is supposed to mitigate them.
In a graph-centric interpretation of the pod,
document URIs are instead ephemeral artifacts of one particular API view
that carry no meaning in the graph,
nor for other views or apps.</p>

        <p>We stress that the document-centric as well as the graph-centric interpretation
are supported by the current Solid specifications,
notably the <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsSourceDocument" href="https://solidproject.org/TR/2021/protocol-20211217">Solid Protocol</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-5">5</a>]</span>,
which is a testament to both the orthogonality of the specification
and the compatibility of graph-centricity.
Specifically,
the graph-centric interpretation of the Solid vision
still embraces document-based access as a core building block for APIs.
What changes is the role played by the document access interface:
rather than the one absolute source of truth of a pod,
we recognize more value in seeing it as one of many views
into a much more elaborate knowledge graph,
for which APIs act as a vessel.
Therefore,
what is in a pod is essentially in the eye of the beholder:
all depends on which view has the best fit for a specific purpose.</p>
