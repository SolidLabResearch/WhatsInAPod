      <!-- Context      -->
      <p>The Solid ecosystem provides specifications
for the publication and consumption of decentralized permissioned data,
stored across multiple locations called <q>Pods</q>.
<!-- Need         -->
A disconnect exists between the practical notion of a Pod
and the protocol that provides access to its data,
creating confusion as to what exactly a Pod is
and how it relates to the technical specifications.
To reinstate clarity,
<!-- Task         -->
we examined possible interpretations of the technological underpinnings,
and compared them from the viewpoints of
storage, publication and query.
<!-- Object       -->
First, this article details
the current understanding of Pods as a collection of Linked Data documents.
Second,
we propose a wider definition
in which a Solid Pod is fundamentally a knowledge graph,
which can be accessed through various Web APIs
that act as views in a database sense.
<!-- Findings     -->
We argue that the latter zoomed-out perspective
enables accessing and querying knowledge within Pods
in more flexible and sustainable ways.
<!-- Conclusion   -->
These insights are crucial to reduce
the dependency of Solid apps on concrete APIs
and local assumptions about the shape and organization of data
and the resulting performance.
<!-- Perspectives -->
The suggested broader perspective supports Solid with
evolving into a heterogeneous but interoperable ecosystem
that accommodates for a multitude of data access patterns.</p>

      <h2 property="schema:name">Introduction</h2>
      <p>In the current state of the Web, companies gather and store large amounts of data on centralized locations, inaccessible for the public and other companies. 
The concepts of data control and privacy have since lost a lot of meaning, as user data is scattered over these centralized data silos with little to no opportunity for users to reuse this data.
<!-- The Solid Proposal --> 
Through the Solid project, Sir Tim Berners Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has aimed to revitalize these concepts of identity and data ownership and privacy for the Web <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]</span>.
Proposed in 2016 as a decentralized platform for social Web applications <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]</span>, Solid defines the concept of personal online datastores (pod) as online data spaces that enable the storage and management of personal data over the Web, where users control the permissions for applications and agents to interact with their data pod.
<!-- Permissions and splitting apps and data -->
To create such an ecosystem of a decentralized network of data pods over the Web, 
the concept of separation of data and application is an important premise.
<!-- Semantics are key -->
Where historically applications can rely on implicit assumptions in the structuring, context and other semantics of data, in the context of online data stores shared by applications and users, assumptions that do not hold for the ecosystem are broken and must be captured in the semantics of the data.
These semantics form the basis for interoperability of data between applications, as these semantics can be interpreted by other applications to reuse this existing data, where prior local assumptions required for the processing of this data may have prevented this.</p>

      <!-- Solid as a set of interfaces -->
      <p>To achieve these goals, Solid is based on a set of specifications that define the protocol to interact with Solid data pods on the Web.
These interfaces define how to add, read and remove resources data on a Solid pod, how to authenticate and how to set permissions for data on your pod for agents and applications on the network.
<!-- Especially the LDP interface -->
To interface with the data stored on a Solid pod, the Linked Data Platform (LDP) specification <a href="">TODO::cite</a> is used. 
The LDP specification proposes an organizational scheme where data is bundled into resources.
These resources are then organized in a hierarchical structure of resources and containers on the data pod.</p>

      <!-- That lead to application bias in the data -->
      <p>As this organization of data in resources and the organization of these resources on the Solid pod is currently done by application, the local assumptions and optimizations made by applications in this organizational structure that is not shared by the ecosystem leads to 
difficulty</p>

      <!-- Made worse by lack of authoritative definition -->
      <p>Next to this, we also notice a lack of an authoritative definition for Solid. 
As the solid ecosystem expands through new initiatives and industry attention is starting to pick up, the lack of an authoritative definition for Solid is starting to show as new initiatives, as the definition shifts more from the original vision towards an understanding of Solid as a sum of the currently used specifications to achieve this vision.</p>

      <!-- We propose a new perspective -->
      <p>With this work, we propose the perspective of viewing a Solid pod as a permissioned knowledge graph that can be exposed over the Web using a multitude of interfaces.
We argue that the organizational structure that the Linked Data Platform specification imposes on the Solid ecosystem through its constraints and degrees of freedom for applications to structure their data, separation of application and data and hence data interoperability is limited.
<!-- With hopes of steering discussion to original vision -->
- Using this work, we hope to steer the discussion over Solid towards the goals of separating application and data through use of semantics in the stored data with the perspective of Solid pods as permissioned knowledge graphs that can be exposed over the Web using a multitude of interfaces.</p>

      <!-- Sections -->
      <p>In <a href="#problem_statement">Section 2</a>, we define how a mismatch in organization and real-world structure of data can lead to problems through local assumptions and optimizations by applications.
<a href="#vision">Section 3</a> shows the proposed perspective of viewing Solid data pods as permissioned knowledge graphs that can be exposed over a multitude of APIs.
In <a href="#comparison">Section 4</a>, we argue through comparisons of specific use-cases how interfaces influence the organization and structure of the data, and can lead to coupling between application and data through localized assumptions, after which a conclusion is formulated in <a href="#conclusion">Section 5</a>.</p>

      <!-- 



The goal of the Solid platform is to present a platform that separates applications and data, creating an ecosystem where multiple applications can seamlessly work with the same data [TODO::cite from somewhere? ask Ruben V?]().
For such an ecosystem to exist, the concept of separation of data and application is an important premise.
Through the separation of data and application, implicit assumptions between application and data are broken and must be captured in the semantics of the data.
These semantics then form the basis of the interoperability of this data between applications, as other applications may now use these semantics to make sense of and reuse existing data, where prior local assumptions by applications may have prevented this.

The Solid project provides a platform based on a set of open standards to manage and interact with data in a Personal Online Datastore (POD) <span class="references">\[<a href="#ref-2">2</a>\]</span>.
With the goal of facilitating the integration of data for applications over the Web, 
through giving individuals control over this data through deciding access rights and choosing the applications and services allowed to interact with this data, 
new paradigms are needed.

However, as the specifications evolved, we see an evolution in direction of Solid being equated to the specifications used to implement the vision, as opposed to the original vision of a next step for the Web to provide separation between data and applications. -->

      <!-- A definition for Solid -->

      <!-- ### Separating data and applications
To achieve an ecosystem where different applications can work with the same data, the separation between the data and the applications / services working with the data is an important premise. -->

      <!-- ### Semantics and data
A key enabler of this separation is the use of RDF and the adding of semantics to data.
The semantic Web was introduced as an extension to the Web to make data machine-readable <span class="references">\[<a href="#ref-3">3</a>\]</span>.
Two decades later, the standards introduced are more relevant than ever in the goal to creating ecosystems that enable data integration and interoperability for applications.
Where large portions of the semantics of currently available data over the web are  historically stored in documentation of APIs scattered over the internet, semantics in data allow the expressiveness of storing these semantics in the data itself. Instead of requiring to read the documentation of a data source to know that `api.com/users/1234/contacs/` results in a JSON list of contacts for user 1234, the Relational Data Format (RDF) enables us to write these semantics in the data itself, where `</users/1234/> foaf:knows </users/1235>`. Irrespective of the interface exposing this data, the relation between both users can be discovered from the semantics in the data without requiring specific understanding of how the data was retrieved and the implicit semantics that were captured in the exposing API.

      <!-- Solid requires splitting of apps and data through semantics -->
      <p>To achieve the envisioned ecosystem of data integration and interoperability, the Solid ecosystem relies on the premise that it is possible to separate applications and data in a meaningful way, so that applications working with the same data in a pod are made interoperable by adding semantics to the stored data in such a way that the data becomes usable for all applications without requiring a specific interface and documentation to interact with stored data <a href="">TODO:: cite Ruben V blog</a>.</p>

      <h3 id="solid-as-linked-data-platform">Solid as Linked Data Platform</h3>
      <!-- LDP leads to mismatch between the restrictions imposed on how data can be stored, and the real world  -->

      <p>The protocol to read, write and organize data on Solid data PODs is based on the Linked Data Platform (LDP) specification <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-4">4</a>]</span>. 
This specification defines a set of rules for HTTP(S) operations on web resources to provide a read-write architecture for Linked Data on the Web. It provides an organizational structure of resources and containers, much in the same way that a file system is organized through files and directories. These resources can either be non-RDF resources storing regular files, images and more, where RDF resources store a collection of Linked Data Quads in a specified RDF format.</p>

      <h4 id="a-mismatch-in-data-organization">A mismatch in data organization</h4>
      <!-- applications are required to make localized optimizations -->
      <p>As the Linked Data Platform specification organizes data as containers and resources, it imposes an inherent hierarchical ordering of resources and containers in the same way that files and directories in a file system create a hierarchical ordering.
It requires all (RDF) data to be bundled as resources and stored using the hierarchical structuring of container and resources. 
These organizational constraints provide challenges for applications that need to store data on a Solid pod.</p>

      <p>However, real world data will not always be easily mapped to a structure that adheres to these constrainst.
As event-based</p>

      <p>As the specifications of the Solid Platform do not impose any specific limitations on how applications must interact with the Linked Data Platform interface exposed by a Solid data POD, any application (given the permission) is free to organize their data in any way they see fit.</p>

      <h4 id="data-is-bundled-into-resources">Data is bundled into resources</h4>
      <p>As data needs to be bundeled into resources, 
The concept of a resource does not pose any constraints on its contents. The contents can either be non-rdf, such as images, or it can container any amount of RDF data quads.</p>

      <h4 id="ldp-as-a-meta-api">LDP as a meta-API</h4>
      <p>The above problems can be derived from the essence of the Linked Data Platform interface. Where LDP can be described as an API within the scope of working with resources on an LDP server, defining how to read, write add and remove resources over HTTP(S), it should be seen as a <strong>meta-api</strong> from a data-modeling perspective.
The LDP specification can represent data in an infinite amount of ways.
It imposes constraints on the way data can be organized, by requiring data to be bundled in resources and requiring these resources to be organized in a hierarchical structure.
On the other hand, LDP leaves degrees of freedom to where every application can through localized assumptions create their own API on top of the LDP interface.
Through the decisions of how the data should be bundled in resources on the pod, sharing the same permissions for all data bundled in a single resource, and the decisions of the hierarchical structuring of this data on the pod, each application in essence creates their own API on top of the LDP interface of a Solid POD through local assumptions and optimizations in the organization of data.
Additionally, in this paradigm, applications themselves are indirectly responsible for the permissions that can be set on the data in a Solid POD. As applications structure data in resources, and structure the organization of resources on a POD, users are limited in the granularity over which they can give access to data on their pod to the granularity of the resources created by the used applications. Because of the organizational structure, permissions that are shared between a container and all members (child containers and resources) of that container are also limited to the assumptions made by the application structuring the data and may not make sense for other use-cases for the same data.</p>

      <p>These consequences go against the vision of Solid providing an ecosystem where data and applications are separated and where API integration is abolished for data integration where applications and services are enabled to directly integrate existing data.</p>

      <h3 id="a-need-for-definition">A need for definition</h3>
      <p>Where above we posed that the Linked Data Platform specification defines an interface that promotes local assumptions and organizational structures for applications storing data on a Solid POD, we see that the line between Solid and Linked Data Platform has been blurred over time <a href="">TODO:: CITATIONS AND EXAMPLES</a>. 
As no authoritive definition of Solid exists (that we know of), we find that multiple initiatives in the Solid ecosystem provide their own vision on the Solid ecosystem, which over time equates more to the idea of Solid as a Linked Data Platform  set of specifications for an online platform than as a vision for a</p>

      <p>In the initial paper, Solid is presented as: “a decentralized platform for social Web applications”</p>

      <p>On the website of the Solid project, we find that: “Solid is a specification that lets people store their data securely in decentralized data stores called Pods. Pods are like secure personal web servers for data. When data is stored in someone’s Pod, they control which people and applications can access it.” <a href="">https:/​/​solidproject.org/</a></p>

      <p>On the Inrupt website <a href="">https:/​/​inrupt.com/solid/</a>, Solid is defined as “a technology for organizing data, applications, and identities on the web. Solid enables richer choices for people, organizations and app developers by building on existing web standards.”</p>

      <p>We notice that where these definitions differ in the identity of Solid as a platform, technology or specification / protocol, we see that there is no specific mention of Linked Data Platform. 
In contrast, the current specifications (WAC, ACP), research <a href="">TODO:: find something good here??</a> and tooling is all focused on viewing Solid as a Linked Data Platform interface.
<a href="">TODO:: we need more content here to prove this point</a>.</p>

      <p>Because of this notion of a Solid POD being equated to the Linked Data Platform interface is exposes, in contrast to viewing this interface as a means to an end to achieve the original goal of splitting applications and data while providing semantics in the data itself, we argue that this current perspective enforces the problems that currently exist with using the Linked Data Platform specification as a base for the Solid ecosystem and limits the potential for innovation and solutions that the Solid ecosystem can bring to the Web.</p>

### Solid as a Linked Data Platform interface

LDP as a meta-API where applications are able to model their data needs.
It puts constraints on the data - resource granularity, hierarchical structuring, but also leaves degrees of freedom used to create additional semantics not captured in the data.
This freedom is used to create API's in the data through local assumptions creating semantics that may not be captured 
However, if we look at the implementation these definitions differ We notice a lack of proper definition for Solid, nor a guideline for used terminology (protocol, platform, ecosystem, ...).in the data itself.
Little support for interoperability in its base form.

#### A mismatch between data organization and the real world
is often caused by the Linked Data Platform interface being restrictive in the way data can be organized over the interface.
The Linked Data Platform specification organizes data in a hierarchical structure, where real-world data does not always follow a hierarchical structure.



#### Semantics in data organization

#### Applications indirectly dictate the permission structure
in their structuring of data on the data pod.
As applications structure data stored on the data pod, 
the resulting data organization on the pod dictates how permissions can be set over this data.
As the data is structured in resources using the hierarchical structuring of the Linked Data Platform interface,
permission granularity over this data is limited to the size of the chosen resources, and not on individual data triples in these resources (in case of RDF resources).
Additionally, interactions with this data is limited to the structuring of these resources, as [TODO:: what more should we put here??]().
 -->

      <!-- 


--------------------------------------------

#### Data granularity
A consequence of using this specification is that data must be organized in resources, as this is the only form of data that can be managed using Linked Data Platform. This requires applications to make local assumptions as to what constitutes a resource and how application data should be distributed over resources in a data pod. As resources are the only interface, other data structures such as databases are impossible, and must be emulated on the client side over the resources exposed by the LDP interface.

#### Organizational semantics
As resources are stored in a hierarchical way due to the nature of the Linked Data Platform specification, the organization of data in a hierarchical order may carry implicit semantics in the organization of resources on a data pod. We see this return in the original paper<span class="references">\[<a href="#ref-2">2</a>\]</span>, where the example is given of an application storing events using a URI path structure based on dates (i.e., /2016/05/01/event1). The problem with these localized assumptions is they do not hold for the ecosystem, and form an application specific API built on Linked Data Platform [TODO:: what more?]().

#### Hierarchical bias
The hierarchical organization of data on a pod also leads to data separation between applications. We see this with e.g. Digita [TODO::source]() providing a separate container for each app, in the same way that the `Program Files` folder provides a location for applications to store data. While this mitigates issues of overwriting data, and adds implicit context to data based on its location (at least for the application managing a certain data space), this comes at the cost of data discovery and integration [TODO:: what more?]().

#### LDP as a meta-API
We argue that the Linked Data Platform interface is not an API, but a meta-API that can organize data in an infinite amount of ways. In the current environment, applications are forced to make local assumptions, and create application-specific API's on the Solid data pods through localized assumptions that do not hold for the ecosystem. This comes at the cost of data discovery and interoperability with different applications that do not share the same assumptions.

### API-integration versus data-integration

As the goal for interoperability of online data spaces is to move from the paradigm of API integration to mode data integration centered approaches of data publishing, we see that Linked Data Platform in it's current state creates API integration issues for applications through localized assumptions in data organization and format / shape [TODO:: maybe also make the point of format / shape integration a bit more]().



The original paper proposes a solution for data discovery through providing a SPARQL interface that runs on top of the data organized in the Linked Data Platform, where every resource serves as its own SPARQL endpoint (https://github.com/nodeSolidServer/node-solid-server/issues/962) which has since been removed from the spec -> this was no solution after all so maybe this should be casually mentioned as a sidenote?
 -->

      <!-- 

As a consequence of these decisions, using the Linked Data Platform interface, reading this contact data requires the knowledge of where the data is stored, and the formatting in which the data is stored to work with the data.

As a consequence of using LDP for the organization of resources on a data pod, the main discovery mechanism over this interface is link traversal through the LDP interface.
This is however a limited approach, as in case an agent tries to retrieve information stored in a public resource at at `&lt;pod_uri&gt;/private/public`, where the parent container `&lt;pod_uri&gt;/private/` is set to be private, the resource cannot be discovered unless the exact URI can be discovered through another means.

In their "extensions to LDP" part of the paper, they propose the "PUT" extension to LDP, with the example of a calendar application
that uses a URI path structure based on dates (i.e., /2016/05/01/event1). A PUT request is to create a new resource called event1,
as well as the missing month (i.e., 05) and day (i.e., 01) containers under /2016.
Here we see again the reliance on the LDP bias (using the slash semantics as semantic information over the stored data instead of explicitly tagging the data with the information), that leads to assumptions being required to discover the data.

The complex data retrieval proposed through SPARQL mentions that optionally a SPARQL endpoint can be provided on a data pod, enabling more complex data queries from a pod, where rdf-resources and metadata for non-rdf resources can be exposed over the interface.
This is to address shortcomings in the LDP interface of not being able to express complex data retrieval operations such as filtering and aggregation. Also proposed here is that pod servers may be responsible for evaluating queries spanning multiple pods by forwarding requests for additional data to other pod servers.

In their related work, it states:
Solid has a strong focus on decoupling data from
applications and in addition ensuring that applications have a simple, generic
and well defined way to access the data stored in the users’ pods.




In Section 5, the paper presents the POD Management system. It defines that pods use LDP to organize data in containers that group resources with every resource and container having their own URI. A pod server should support 
- LDP
- patching (N3-patch, former SPARQL update)
- access control lists (ACL), potentially to be updated to access control policies (ACP).
- live updates
- optionally SPARQL

They advise storage mechanisms for RDF data to use triple stores to facilitate querying.

From all this information, we infer that their approach is focused on data discovery and querying happening mainly over a SPARQL interface that has a full index of all data that is available to the agent querying over the pod and can fulfill these requirements on the server side.



### LDP as an API
Additionally, we also argue that LDP is not an API: it’s a meta-API. 
There are still an infinite amount of ways to expose knowledge over LDP. 
We notice existing work and apps get this wrong[TODO::cite]().


Because of this, we see that the promise of Solid moving the equation from API-integration to data-integration does not hold.
As LDP cannot be viewed as a simple API, the problem of integrating different API's to access data from different sources 
has been translated into requiring knowledge of different writing / storage methods to access data stored on different pods by different applications,
leading to a different kind of API integration, without providing the data-integration that was promised. -->

      <!-- 


------------------------------------------------------------------




A disconnect exists between the practical notion of a Pod and the protocol that provides access to its data, creating confusion as to what exactly a Pod is and how it relates to the technical specifications.

- LDP creates biases in the stored data?
- data integration issues w LDP?


- spec updates evolved the understanding of Solid pods
- the technical specifications put limits on the way data can be interacted with
- to attain the goal of replacing the API integration with data integration, have to work around the limitations of LDP or build alternative interfaces on top.




The current state of LDP makes us think of pods as collections of Linked Data Documents

We see a fundamental mismatch with usage.
We see different apps making local assumptions and optimizations that do not hold for the ecosystem and essentially because of ACL reasons

LDP creates a BIAS in the stored data? e.g. data has to be grouped at a certain location in a resource?
Also the notion that LDP is not an API. It’s a meta-API; there are still infinity ways to expose knowledge through LDP. So existing work and apps get this wrong.

-> The promise of data integration instead of API integration is not satisfied? - This was a point we came up with, however this can be (kinda) solved in the tooling used so ?
-> ...

The Mansouroriginal Solid paper already alluded to shortcomings of the LDP interface (globbing, a separate SPARQL interface for RDF data / metadata)
-> And we will make the argument / take the position that it is more fundamental, that LDP is the problem/limitation rather than the solution. We reframe by seeing one LDP API (there are multiple!) as a possible view on the Pod, which fundamentally is a KG.

      <p>in our perspective is a Knowledge Graph where any collection of data can be grouped under a specific set of user permissions or policies.</p>

      <h3 id="api-integration">API integration</h3>
      <p>A consequence of an ecosystem where knowledge graphs can be exposed over the Web over multiple interfaces, is that this brings us back to the problem of interface-integration.</p>

      <p>For this perspective to work, we must strive to transition from an ecosystem of API integration towards an ecosystem of data integration.</p>

      <p>We argue that the use of Linked Data Platform as an organizational structure for data on a Solid pod relies too much on applications creating localized assumptions and optimizations for the structuring of their data that do not hold for the ecosystem, leading to applications requiring to do API integration on top of these structures, where semantics of the data may encoded and lost in this structuring instead of the data itself.</p>

      <p>Where assumptions are currently contained in the API used to organize the data on a data pod, we need to move these assumptions to the data and explicitly encode them into the semantics of the data.</p>

      <p>In the perspective as a pod being a permissioned Knowledge Graph that can be exposed over a multitude of APIs, we argue that exposing data over well-defined APIs can alleviate API integration problems.
<a href="">TODO:: HOWW???</a></p>

      <h3 id="interface-building-blocks">Interface building blocks</h3>

      <p>In this context, we can view the current state of Solid as pods that expose their internal knowledge graph over building blocks for authorization (WAC / ACP), data management and querying (LDP) and authentication (Solid-OIDC).
In this context, interface building blocks in the ecosystem should try to be minimally interdependent, to promote reuse over multiple interfaces for other components of Solid.</p>

      <p>As a practical example, where the original paper advertised SPARQL as a possible interface to optimize querying on top of the Linked Data Platform data management layer <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]</span>, we propose that a SPARQL endpoint may serve as a querying and data management interface on top of the knowledge graph, requiring new building blocks to be researched for authorization over such an interface.</p>

      <hr />

      <p>With this work, we propose the view of Solid as being data and application independent.</p>

      <p>With this work, we argue that it is not per se the interface of Linked Data Platform that is the cause of issues, but the notion that a Solid pod must adhere to the notion of being an online data space that organizes data as resources over a Linked Data Platform interface.
We pose that the assumptions described above that stem from the use of this organizational structure and the limitations it poses on the data it stores.</p>

      <p>We propose the vision of Solid as a platform serving data pods that organize data as a Knowledge Graph <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-5">5</a>]</span> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-6">6</a>]</span>.</p>

      <p>A network of Solid pods can be seen as a decentralized knowledge graph.</p>

      <p>If a pod can be seen as a Knowledge graph, exposing the contained knowledge can take many forms, as knowledge graphs traditionally have supported multiple interfaces to add, manage and query data <a href="">TODO::sources</a>.</p>

      <p>Say something about integrating interfaces for authorization, data management and querying as building blocks in the ecosystem.</p>

      <p>In this vision, a pod can be considered a permissioned, hybrid Knowledge graph that can be accessed through various Web APIs.</p>

      <!-- 

In the original paper for Solid, there was alluded on exposing all data over a SPARQL endpoint

Wat is solid?
- is het een set van protocols?
- is het een concept geimplementeerd met een set protocols?


Solutions can be found through:

extensions to the LDP interface:
- in spec 
- out of spec client managed?
- out of spec client sided?




### Authorization

- Resources are a straightforward way of combining data triples for authorization purposes.
- autorization systems can be adapted to work on a triple basis OR
- other ways of combining triples in resources can be used that do not include LDP biases (slash semantics)

<div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
      <h2 property="schema:name">Comparison</h2>

      <p>In this section, we examine possible interpretations of the technological underpinnings, and compared them from the viewpoints of storage, publication and query.</p>

      <p>In this step, we compare the frameworks of thinking about Solid as a collection of resources exposed over Linked Data Platform, compared to Solid as a Knowledge Graph exposed over a [meta-]model-based interfaces (SPARQL, TPF, …).</p>

      <h3 id="managing-events">Managing events</h3>
      <p>For a first comparison, we take an application that works with events.
Given an event consisting of a timestamp, a type, and a message.
In the Solid ecosystem, how can an application store this data on a POD?</p>

      <h4 id="in-the-case-of-an-ldp-interface">In the case of an LDP interface</h4>
      <p>the application will first need to bundle the data it wants to write into resources. In the case of events or other objects with a logical structure, the straightforward approach is to create a separate resource for each event. An alternative approach could be to bundle events in a single resource, but this comes at the cost of the granularity over which permissions can be assigned to events.</p>

      <p>With the resources created, the application now wants to store them on a Solid pod.
If the application does not have access to a location on the pod, it can start up a negotiation protocol to receive access to write data to the pod.
With access given to the pod, the application now needs to organize the created resources in a structure that can be written over the LDP interface of data pod.</p>

      <p>A first option would be for the application to just write all resources to a single container the application has access to, together with all other application data. Combining all data in resources in a single container means the application is not making any assumptions as to the organization of data. However, in this case, the LDP interface does nothing to help the application find previously stored data, as it either has to keep an internal state in the application of where resources were stored, or check all resources on the pod until a match is found.</p>

      <p>Because of this, it is more interesting for applications to create structure in their data, as through these structures, applications can more easily retrieve written data. To create this structure, the application can create an <code>events</code> folder in their allocated data space, and store all event resources in this <code>&lt;storage_space&gt;/events/</code> location. Now any time the applications wants to read or write events, it can make the local assumption that all event related data <em>written by the application</em> will be stored at this <code>events</code> folder.</p>

      <p>But as the application expects to be working with large amounts of event data, it might decide that further optimizations are required. For this purpose, it might want to choose to organize the data according to one of its properties such as the timestamp of the event, or the type of the event. In this case, an event might be stored as the following resource on the pod: <code>&lt;storage_space&gt;/events/2022/01/01/event1.ttl</code>.</p>

      <p>We see that the events stored by the application are now structured according to the assumptions and optimizations done by the application.</p>

      <p>From a <strong>storage</strong> standpoint, the event data is stored on the file system of the POD server as a file, or may be stored in a graph database where the data is tagged as part of that resource, so that the resource can be reconstructed in its entirety.</p>

      <p>From a <strong>publication</strong> standpoint, all data of an event is published as a resource over the POD LDP interface on a location that is tied to the application-specific organization of data.</p>

      <p>From a <strong>query</strong> standpoint, the data must first be discovered on the pod, after which it can be queried directly through dereferencing the relevant resources or by an abstraction on the client that provides access to the data over another interface.
Data discovery can happen using brute-force retrieval of all available resources, but is limited by the permissions an agent has over what can be viewed on the data pod. Additionally, public resources in private containers may lead to brute-force methods not discovering these resources and not including the contained data in their results.
Options external to the LDP interface such as the Type Indexing system <a href="">TODO:: refer</a> and Shape Trees <a href="">TODO:: refer</a> can optimize this process, but as of yet are not mandatory in the specifications and are not required to be managed by the server <a href="">TODO:: is this true for shape trees??</a>.</p>

      <h4 id="in-the-case-of-meta-model-based-interfaces">In the case of [meta-]model-based interfaces</h4>
      <p>the application is not required to do additional data modeling.
Data can be written as-is to the pod, over any available endpoint exposed by the pod.
The received data is then stored</p>

      <p>From a <strong>storage</strong> standpoint, the event data is stored in a graph-based database on the Pod server.</p>

      <p>from a <strong>publication</strong> standpoint, multiple interfaces can be used</p>

      <p>From a <strong>query</strong> standpoint</p>

      <h3 id="storing-events-on-a-pod">Storing events on a Pod</h3>
      <p>A first concrete example we can give is the example of storing events on a Solid pod.
Events are a wide-spread</p>

      <p>We will make this comparison based on the aspects of storage of the data on the pod server, the publication of the data over the Web, and querying of data over the interface.</p>

      <h4 id="storage">Storage</h4>

      <h4 id="publication">Publication</h4>

      <h4 id="query">Query</h4>

      <p><strong>queries and APIs are separate concepts</strong></p>

      <h3 id="comparing-interfaces">Comparing interfaces</h3>
      <p>A common misconception is that a server interface should be identical to the client interface <a href="">TODO::cite and word according to Ruben blog</a>. 
Interfaces however can be abstracted away in a proxy (A web page abstracting an SQL interface in filters), or on the client (Comunica abstracting away a TPF server as SPARQL)<a href="">TODO::cite</a>.</p>

      <p>For decentralized networks of data sources such as the Solid ecosystem, these abstractions will mainly be the building blocks for applications to work with data stored on the pods.</p>

      <p>We pose that the interface exposing the server Knowledge Graph influences the possibilities and biases for abstractions created over them.
As the Linked Data Platform allows data to be retrieved by retrieving the resources present in the containers and resources advertised by the main index <a href="">TODO:: wording??</a>, consequences of the interface such as public resources in private containers not being discoverable through link traversal of the LDP index will limit the abstractions that can be created over the interface.</p>

      <p>Where initiatives such as the Solid Interoperability Specification <a href="">TODO::cite</a> work to provide answers for these use-cases, they are bound to the organization of data on a pod imposed by the Linked Data Platform specification.</p>

      <h3 id="data-storage-comparison">Data storage comparison</h3>
      <p>Different interfaces exposing data of a knowledge graph may require different storage solutions to access the underlying data.
Note that again here building blocks providing conversions for different interfaces on specific storage mechanisms may be implemented.</p>

      <h4 id="linked-data-platform-interfaces">Linked data platform interfaces</h4>
      <p>can use multiple approaches for data storage. The original Solid introduction paper <a href="">TODO::cite</a> proposed a file-based backend for the storage of non-rdf resources, where rdf resources were stored in a file-based or graph-based system dependent on the optional support for SPARQL over the resources in the pod.</p>

      <h4 id="meta-model-based-interfaces">[meta-]model-based interfaces</h4>
      <p>may require more elaborate back-end support depending on the interface exposed. As interfaces such as SPARQL and TPF interfaces rely mostly on an indexed data graph storage mechanisms<a href="">TODO:: …</a>, 
Support for non-rdf resources must always be taken into account, requiring some sort of organizational structure for these resources to be setup.</p>

      <h3 id="data-publication-comparison">Data publication comparison</h3>
      <p>The data management interface used by a Solid pod influences how the internal data is published over the Web.
The interface directs how data can be accessed, the granularity of</p>

      <h4 id="linked-data-platform-interfaces-1">Linked data platform interfaces</h4>
      <p>provide a resource-based data organization organized according to the Linked Data Platform specification.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>slash semantics - bias</li>
        <li>data discovery difficulties (type index, interop spec, …)</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="meta-model-based-interfaces-1">[meta-]model-based interfaces</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>quad / view?-based</li>
        <li>discovery through interface index (SPARQL, TPF, …)</li>
        <li>non-RDF resource metadata indexing (as in original paper)</li>
        <li>…</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="data-querying-comparison">Data querying comparison</h3>
      <p>The organizational structure of data published over the interface influences the query resolution and optimization process.
Other differences such as the granularity with which the data can be accessed influences the querying process.</p>

      <h4 id="linked-data-platform-interfaces-2">Linked data platform interfaces</h4>
      <p>rely for querying on their data organization, or on derived interfaces to support querying requirements.
As data discovery is hindered by local assumptions made by applications in the organization of data and their shape, either knowledge about the organization of data, or brute forcing of the available resources is required to discover and retrieve data relevant to a query.
The inclusion of optional SPARQL support in the first iterations of the Solid specification <a href="">TODO::cite</a> supports this.</p>

      <h4 id="meta-model-based-interfaces-2">[meta-]model-based interfaces</h4>
      <p>require the client to discover the exposed interface, and adopt the querying strategy accordingly. A practical example of this is the comunica querying framework, that can adapt its querying strategy according to the datasource interface <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-7">7</a>]</span>.
Querying performance and evaluation is dependent on the exposed interface.
Assumptions on the shape of data contained in the internal knowledge graph still provide the same challenges, but the organizational structure of data should be abstracted away for clients working with and querying the data.</p>

      <h3 id="how-does-the-framing-of-pods-as-a-knowledge-graph-solve-the-api-integration-problem">How does the framing of pods as a Knowledge Graph solve the API integration problem?</h3>

      <p>In the problem statement, we pose that Linked Data Platform is a meta-API that leads to API integration problems.
How does this solve this issue?</p>

      <p>We first pose that API’s are a means of syncing data between systems <a href="">TODO:: cite</a>, and data retrieval will always happen over an API (even direct retrieval implicates an API, as you know the location of the resource, etc …) <a href="">TODO:: …</a>.</p>

      <p>The problem with enforcing Linked Data Platform as the single meta-API for Solid is that biases and</p>

      <!-- 
the APIs are just a means of syncing data between systems 
(see https://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2021/12/23/reflections-of-knowledge/#abstracting-away-p-4) 
-> Granted but this does not really provide the comforting words that "we will change the API-integration hell into a data-integration opportunity".

cons -> need to support multiple interfaces
pros -> used interface should not have influence on the exposed data, just on how it can be accessed, as the context remains the same? -> something like this but requires some extra thinking? -->

<div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
      <h2 property="schema:name">Conclusion</h2>

      <p>In this work, we proposed the perspective of viewing the Solid pod as a permissioned Knowledge Graph. 
While this perspective does not in itself solve the existing issues with longevity of application interoperability in the Solid ecosystem, it provides a framework that can be used to tackle the present challenges in a way that is more dependent on the data and less dependent on the interfaces used to expose the data over the Web</p>

      <p>Where the current state of Solid as a datastore organized according to its Linked Data Platform interface limits the innovation surface through applications creating localized assumptions,</p>

      <p>We believe this perspective provides the required framing for Solid to fully take the next step from being an ecosystem still centered around API integration through localized assumptions creating application specific interfaces through data organization over LDP, towards an ecosystem centered around data integration over well-defined interfaces  <a href="">TODO:: this and more</a>.</p>

      <p>With this work, we do not propose any specific takeaway as to which interfaces may optimize the current problems of data shape and organization when building applications on top of Solid, but want to provide a framework with which these problems can be tackled in a way that is not restricted to only what the LDP interface allows.</p>

      <!-- -------------------

The insights proposed in this work are crucial to eliminate 
the dependency of Solid apps on concrete APIs.
Local assumptions about the shape and organization of data creating localized APIs for applications over the Linked Data Platform interface exposed by Solid data pods provide local optimizations for data discovery, querying performance and more, but hurt the ecosystem as a whole, as assumptions and biases in the organization and discovery of data are not shared across the ecosystem.

The framing of Solid pods as a Knowledge Graph exposed over a multitude of APIs contrary to a data source organized using the Linked Data Platform specification enables us to think more about 
with the goal of reducing local assumptions and optimizations in apps for reasons of longevity. The API over which data is exposed over the Web is a means to an end, and should not define the platform. -->
