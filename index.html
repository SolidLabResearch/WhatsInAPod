      <!-- Context      -->
      <p>The Solid vision aims to make data independent of applications
through technical specifications,
which detail how to publish and consume permissioned data
across multiple autonomous locations called <q>pods</q>.
<!-- Need         -->
The current document-centric interpretation of Solid,
wherein a pod is solely a hierarchy of Linked Data documents,
cannot fully realize this envisaged independence.
Applications are left to define their own APIs
within the Solid Protocol,
which leads to fundamental interoperability problems
and the need for associated workarounds.
The broader longterm vision for Solid is confounded
with the concrete HTTP interface to pods today,
leading to a narrower solution space to address these core issues.
<!-- Task         -->
We examine the mismatch between the vision
and the prevalent document-centric interpretation,
and propose a reconciliatory graph-centric interpretation
wherein a pod is fundamentally a knowledge graph.
<!-- Object       -->
In this article,
we contrast the existing and proposed interpretations
in terms of how they support the Solid vision.
We argue that the knowledge-centric interpretation
can improve pod access through different Web APIs
that act as views in a database sense.
<!-- Findings     -->
We show that our zoomed-out interpretation
provides improved opportunities for
storage, publication, and querying of decentralized data
in more flexible and sustainable ways.
<!-- Conclusion   -->
These insights are crucial to reduce
the dependency of Solid apps on implicit API semantics
and local assumptions about the shape and organization of data
and the resulting performance.
<!-- Perspectives -->
The suggested broader interpretation can guide Solid
through its evolution into a heterogeneous yet interoperable ecosystem
that accommodates a multitude of read/write data access patterns.</p>

        <h2 property="schema:name">The Solid vision</h2>
        <!-- problem: your data being everywhere, no control very limited interoperability -->
        <p>On today’s Web,
data privacy and control have lost ground.
User-generated data is stored in centralized data silos,
in which people have neither the control nor the knowledge to manage how their data is being used <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]</span>.
<!-- Solid: a vision for a better Web -->
As a response to this, the Solid project was created with the aim of revitalizing the Web <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]</span>.
Where the current system of centralized data silos create an ecosystem of limited integration, availability and innovation,
Solid brings a course correction for the Web.
<!-- ecosystem goal: control over data, interoperability over applications and data -->
Based on the separation of applications and data on the Web,
the vision defines an ecosystem that facilitates the integration of data in applications, while keeping people in direct control of their data <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]</span>.</p>

        <!-- the Solid pod -->
        <p>Solid introduces the concept of a <em>pod</em>
as an online data space for people to control and manage their data on the Web.
These pods form a decentralized Solid ecosystem,
from which applications can directly integrate data from the user’s Solid pod,
after receiving their permission.
This is in contrast to current Web applications, where
this data first had to be collected in a centralized location,
after which the platform-specific API had to be integrated,
where all the while user control is at the mercy of the platforms maintaining the data <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]</span>.</p>

        <!-- key for achieving requirement: capture semantics in the data -->
        <p>A precondition to the separation of data and application
is the capture of semantic information in the data itself.
This way, applications can interpret the data without 
requiring specific knowledge encoded in the API over which the data is retrieved. A key driver here is the use of the <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-rdf11-concepts-20140225/">Resource Description Framework (RDF)</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-3">3</a>]</span>, which provides an infrastructure for the capture of this semantic information in the data.
This again stands in contrast to the current Web APIs,
where data is often served in formats that require additional semantics to be captured in the documentation of the API.
In this way, the Solid ecosystem aims to start a transition
from a Web ecosystem of API integration towards
a Web ecosystem centered around data integration <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-4">4</a>]</span>.</p>

        <!-- Now this vision has to be made a reality -->
        <p>Starting from the vision of this ecosystem,
the challenge is to capture its concepts
in specifications for the Web.
<!-- The vision is room for many interpretations -->
The vision is based on broad concepts of interoperability
and user control,
so the realization can take different forms.
<!-- there is no authoritative definition -->
As there is no authoritative definition for Solid,
current initiatives and specifications defining the ecosystem are based on specific interpretations of the Solid vision.</p>

        <p>In <a href="#document-centric">Section 2</a>, we describe the interpretation of the Solid vision as a document-centric ecosystem, which is the understanding on which most of the current Solid ecosystem is based.
In response to the limitations of this interpretation, 
we present a zoomed-out perspective of a graph-centric interpretation of the Solid ecosystem in <a href="#graph-centric">Section 3</a>.
We describe how this perspective creates a broader base for innovation,
by expanding upon the current state of the ecosystem.</p>

  <section id="document-centric" inlist="" rel="schema:hasPart" resource="#document-centric">
<div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
        <h2 property="schema:name">Current document-centric interpretation</h2>
        <!-- The first interpretation we look at is document-centric. -->
        <p>The currently prevailing understanding of Solid
is that of a <em>document-centric ecosystem</em>,
where a pod is considered to be entirely defined
as a permissioned hierarchy of documents and containers.
The pod manages data as a document storage system,
similar to how a file system organizes data
as files and directories.
Structured data is exposed through RDF documents,
which are typically (although not observably for applications)
materialized next to non-RDF resources in a document-based backend.
The separation of application and data is realized
by storing data in documents inside the pod on a separate server,
of which applications are clients.
User control is maintained on via document-level permission management.</p>

        <h3 id="the-solid-protocol">The Solid Protocol</h3>

        <p>On a specification level,
client access to the server-side document structure
is governed by the <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsSourceDocument" href="https://solidproject.org/TR/2021/protocol-20211217"><em>Solid Protocol</em></a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-5">5</a>]</span>.
Derived from the <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsSourceDocument" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/"><em>Linked Data Platform (LDP)</em> specification</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-6">6</a>]</span>,
the Solid Protocol is a <em>client–server specification</em>
that augments the <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsSourceDocument" href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110"><em>HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</em></a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-7">7</a>]</span>
with agreements for accessing and manipulating generic containers and documents
in a <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsSourceDocument" href="https://solid.github.io/web-access-control-spec/">permissioned way</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-8">8</a>]</span>,
additionally detailing the modification of <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsSourceDocument" href="https://solidproject.org/TR/2021/protocol-20211217">RDF documents</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-5">5</a>]</span> specifically.
It thereby enables defining custom document interfaces,
and provides a direct view on the document organization of a pod.
<!--  The authorization interface -->
Authorization is similarly based on the document structure,
and can be realized via
<a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsSourceDocument" href="https://solid.github.io/web-access-control-spec/"><em>Web Access Controls (WAC)</em></a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-8">8</a>]</span> 
or <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsSourceDocument" href="https://solid.github.io/authorization-panel/acp-specification/"><em>Access Control Policy (ACP)</em></a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-9">9</a>]</span>.
Even though WAC and ACP differ in their handling of permissions,
both assume a document hierarchy,
where the granularity through which data sharing can be managed
is defined by the granularity of data in the documents on the pod.</p>

        <p>Like HTTP and LDP,
the <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsSourceDocument" href="https://solidproject.org/TR/2021/protocol-20211217">Solid Protocol</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-5">5</a>]</span>
thus only defines generic rules
to interact with individual resources identified by a URL,
and does not constrain how data is modeled or structured
across these resources.
More formally,
it defines a <span property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/describes" resource="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-7518-7_2"><a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-7518-7_2">protocol</a></span> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-10">10</a>]</span>
consisting of interaction constraints,
but it does not define an <span property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/describes" resource="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-7518-7_2"><a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-7518-7_2">API</a></span> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-10">10</a>]</span>
with specific expectations
of what resources are exposed by this protocol.
For example,
the Solid Protocol provides <em>slash semantics</em>
to indicate hierarchical relationships between documents and their parent container
via slash characters (<code>/</code>) in their URL,
but it does not impose any specific container identifiers or contents.</p>

        <p>Instead,
concrete APIs within this protocol
are de facto created and managed by individual applications.
These will assume that specific contents are to be found
in hard-coded locations such as <code>/movies/</code> or <code>/private/</code>
(in the latter case even coupling the document organization structure
 of a pod to its permissioning system).
The structure and semantics of these ad-hoc APIs are usually undocumented,
leading to implicit application-to-application contracts.
So-called <em>client–client specifications</em> are underway
to constrain APIs for specific use cases,
such as for <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsEvidence" href="https://solid.github.io/webid-profile/">personal profiles</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-11">11</a>]</span>.
However,
continuing this line of work
would imply the creation of such specifications
for every domain model,
given that Solid aims to function for arbitrary kinds of data.
As such,
<a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsPotentialSolution" href="https://shapetrees.org/TR/specification/">other efforts</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-12">12</a>, <a href="#ref-13">13</a>]</span>
instead try to address the problem generically
within the bounds of the document-oriented protocol,
by making some of the document structure of the pod explicit to clients.</p>

        <h3 id="interoperability-challenges">Interoperability challenges</h3>
        <!-- Interoperability problems -->
        <p>Since the Solid protocol
leaves the definition of the API up to individual applications,
app developers are left with many degrees of freedom.
The resulting implicit API semantics endangers the application/data separation,
because the accessibility of the data then depends
on the assumptions made by certain apps.
This cause the Solid vision’s central concepts of interoperability and control
to depend on local, application-specific decisions.</p>

        <!-- This proposes Solid as a document-centric ecosystem. -->
        <p>Let us examine conflicts that arise
via three common applications that use similar data
but impose different demands on an LDP interface to that data.
The first is an <strong>address book app</strong>
where the user views and edits
all details of their professional contacts.
The second is a <strong>birthday app</strong>,
which lets the user message people on their birthday.
The third is a <strong>dating app</strong>
that allows the user to interact with people
on a photo and first-name basis.
To exemplify real-world consequences,
we strive to give each app minimal access.
The address book can access all personal fields for non-dating contacts;
the birthday app can see name, birthdate, and messaging details of all contacts;
the dating app can access first name, profile picture,
and messaging details of dating contacts.
We use these to illustrate that even simple examples
can easily expose four kinds of mismatches
within a interpretation where the pod <em>is</em> the document hierarchy:</p>

        <!-- hierarchy mismatch -->
        <p><strong>(i) Internal API modeling mismatches.</strong>
Each app needs to define a single consistent hierarchy
to serialize their data,
which does not reflect the complex nature of real-world organization.
For instance,
the contact app could organize people in categories
such as <code>/contacts/work/</code> and <code>/contacts/sports/</code>,
which leads to duplication when your colleague
is also a member of your amateur football team.
Hierarchical organizations are thus constrained
in their ability to uniquely represent the real world.</p>

        <p><strong>(ii) External API modeling mismatches.</strong>
Apps can make vastly different assumptions 
on how they structure contact data.
The document hierarchy does not inherently provide interoperability;
this requires either additional interfaces and agreements
or a different interpretation of the documents by applications.
The contacts and birthday apps would need
to store information in the same <code>/contacts/</code> container.
Failure to do so would result in apps not being aware of 
the others’ data being available on the pod.
Even if they do,
their preferences regarding the organization of that container might vary.
Different contexts might form the basis for address book organization,
whereas the birthday app does not understand
the difference between a colleague or family member,
and would hence not know where to write.
It might instead organize people by birthday month,
which in turn would be nonsensical to the address book.</p>

        <p><strong>(iii) Permission mismatches.</strong>
The coupling of permissions to document organization
provides the main mechanism of control,
but it is based on the flawed assumption
that only one hierarchy exists to organize information.
As permissions are directly tied to specific documents,
the granularity of user control is limited;
and so is that of <span property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/describes" resource="https://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1060745.1060835"><a href="https://www2005.org/cdrom/docs/p613.pdf"><em>provenance</em> and <em>trust</em></a></span> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-14">14</a>]</span>,
which seem to be implicitly tied to the notion of a document.
For the birthday and dating apps,
address information should <em>not</em> be part of the contact document;
in contrast, the contacts app
would put all contact details into a single document
to apply the same permissioning rules.
As the assumptions do not match,
the user becomes torn between overly granular control
or giving apps too much access.
Similarly, applications sharing the data may assume 
that contact fields are stored in a granular way,
and may wrongly share too many contact details.</p>

        <p><strong>(iv) Local optimization mismatches.</strong>
Current Solid apps are commonly seen
trying to optimize the document-based API
for access patterns that are specific to their needs.
For the contacts app,
one document per contact might be beneficial.
The birthday app might find it more optimal
to have a single document with names and birthdates,
or perhaps one document per month.
The dating app might want the document per contact
to include all exchanged messages,
which would be unnecessary overhead for the other apps.</p>

        <h3 id="limited-knowledge-graph-interpretation">Limited knowledge graph interpretation</h3>
        <!-- The document-centric vision as a KG -->
        <p>To improve upon these problems, 
we see attempts at reconciling the document hierarchy
of the Solid pod with the interpretation as a knowledge graph.
Shortcomings of the LDP interface for querying
were already mentioned in early iterations of the Solid protocol <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]</span>,
with solutions hinting at per-document SPARQL endpoints
to enable more complex data retrieval.
More recently, the Enterprise Solid Server implementation by Inrupt 
started providing an optional RDF quad-based interface <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-15">15</a>]</span>. 
In this perspective of the Solid pod document hierarchy as a knowledge graph,
the document organization should no longer
be a limiting factor for interoperability.
Applications can query directly RDF data,
even though this data may be spread across 
multiple documents with different organizations within the pod.
This perspective of a Solid pod as a knowledge graph is also 
not limited to the server, as this distillation process
from document hierarchy to knowledge graph
could happen fully on the client side via the LDP interface.</p>

        <!-- Still has problems -->
        <p>However, even with this perspective on the Solid pod, 
which tries to ignore the document organization of the Solid pod,
we still run into its limitations:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>The solution only impacts clients going through this optional interface,
whereas other applications coding assumptions against the 
document hierarchy are still limited in their interoperability, 
and do not share the incentive to write rich semantic data to the pod.</li>
          <li>Writing data is still constrained to the document hierarchy,
as all data must be stored in the context of a document on the pod.
This maintains the problems of writing to common
documents and containers.</li>
          <li>The distillation process from document hierarchy to knowledge graph
is open to client interpretation, and may be limited by client understanding
or include interface-specific information.</li>
          <li>The management of permissions is still
tied to the document hierarchy of the Solid pod, and cannot be
defined in terms of the individual statements in the data.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Where the current innovation surface for the Solid ecosystem still leaves options,
we already feel the constraints imposed by the document hierarchy limiting the options.
Even at its currently small scale, 
the ecosystem’s interoperability and user control are constrained.
New innovations in the ecosystem
such as the <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" href="https://solid.github.io/data-interoperability-panel/specification/">application interoperability specification</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-16">16</a>]</span>

are limited by the imposed document structure,
and have to work around these limitations.</p>

        <h2 property="schema:name">Proposed graph-centric interpretation</h2>

        <p>Because of the limitations of the document-centric interpretation of the Solid ecosystem,
we feel that a shift in perspective is necessary 
to evolve in a way that promotes longevity.
Whereas an ecosystem built on document sharing
provides a limited surface for innovation,
an ecosystem built on data sharing
not constrained to a specific (implicit or explicit) API
provides more opportunities for innovation.
Attempts to improve queryablity
through optional <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/cites" href="http://emansour.com/research/lusail/solid_protocols.pdf">SPARQL</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-2">2</a>]</span>

demonstrate the desire
for a knowledge-graph interpretation
from at least a query perspective.</p>

        <h3 id="pod-as-a-knowledge-graph">Pod as a knowledge graph</h3>

        <p>This leads us to propose the definition of the Solid pod as fundamentally being a <em>permissioned, hybrid knowledge graph, exposed through Web APIs</em>.
This understanding of the Solid pod shifts the premise from data contained in documents to documents built on top of data.</p>

        <!-- permissioned -->
        <ul>
          <li><em>Permissioned</em> expresses the ability to manage permissions over any individual nodes or relation in the knowledge graph.
Rather than being narrowly restricted to basic read/write/control permissions,
the underlying knowledge graph could express more complex <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/describes" href="https://content.iospress.com/download/semantic-web/sw289?id=semantic-web%2Fsw289">usage policies</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-18">18</a>, <a href="#ref-17">17</a>]</span>.
Even more widely,
rather than just permissioned or policy-aware,
data could in general be <em>parameterized</em>
such that any number of parameters can be retained for nodes and relations in the knowledge graph. 
<!-- hybrid --></li>
          <li><em>Hybrid</em> emphasizes that the knowledge graph can store any kind of data (images, videos, etc.) as nodes in the knowledge graph 
in the form of blobs, possibly with associated metadata.
<!-- knowledge graph --></li>
          <li><em>Knowledge graph</em> is to be interpreted following an inclusive definition <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-19">19</a>]</span> as
“<em>a graph of data intended to accumulate and convey knowledge of the real world,
whose nodes represent entities of interest and whose edges represent relations between these entities.</em>”</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Web APIs -->
        <p>The definition further allows exposing this knowledge graph using any suitable Web API,
so that the possibilities of the ecosystem are not constrained by the capabilities of any single API.</p>

        <h3 id="multiple-apis-as-views">Multiple APIs as views</h3>
        <!-- The interpretation -->
        <p>With the proposed definition, we want to provide a zoomed-out perspective on the Solid ecosystem that allows for multi-perspective interpretations.
Whereas in the current ecosystem, one specific document hierarchy is considered to be <em>the</em> pod and hence a constraining factor,
we instead contend that a specific API over the Solid Protocol
can be interpreted as just one of many possibilities
to represent the internal hybrid knowledge graph of a pod.
By shifting the interpretation of a document hierarchy from <em>the</em> authoritative source
to <em>one</em> representation of a pod’s data, we can construct any number of hierarchies 
(or other interfaces) over the underlying knowledge graph.
These can be built on the Solid pod server,
by a client, or even an intermediary.</p>

        <p>The mismatches described in the previous section
can then be resolved
by providing apps with a corresponding API
such that the modeling, permission, and optimization constraints
of different apps are no longer in conflict.
Modeling concerns of a single app can be alleviated
by exposing the same data through multiple hierarchies,
since “duplicates” simply become different views of the same resource.</p>

        <!-- The current Solid protocol as a KG -->
        <p>Importantly,
a graph-based interpretation
is fully compatible with the Solid Protocol,
and in fact recognizes that this protocol
gives rise to <em>multiple</em> APIs.
It changes the role of the Solid Protocol
from the mechanism to expose the API that <em>is</em> the pod,
to being one mechanism for exposing APIs
that <em>represent</em> the pod as one relevant view of its underlying graph.
Whereas the current ecosystem restricts permissions
to a singular document hierarchy,
the zoomed-out perspective
enables the construction of the document hierarchy based on 
the policies in the knowledge graph.
By only including data in documents for which permissions are granted,
we can reuse the current protocols 
but shift their position in the ecosystem to better 
reflect their function as an interface to the data in a pod.</p>

        <p>However, not all translations are seamless.
While a knowledge graph can be distilled by merging documents in a hierarchy,
the inverse operation requires explicit view definitions and semantics,
detailing for instance the use of named graphs
(as is currently proposed for an <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsEvidence" href="https://docs.inrupt.com/ess/latest/query/qpf-endpoint/">optional query interface</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-15">15</a>]</span>).
Similarly, the current authorization mechanisms
only apply to documents,
so different mechanisms are necessary to express policies
over the underlying knowledge graph.</p>

        <!-- Make point that a document FUNDAMENTALLY is built on application assumptions -->

        <!-- Synthese: perfect naast elkaar leven -->

        <!-- Make harsher point maybe -->

        <!-- Mkae point van Comparible on READ - problems of writing and management for data are problematic on document structure -->

        <h2 property="schema:name">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Different interpretations of the Solid vision
come with different abilities to support that vision.
The dominant document-centric interpretation,
specified by the <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsSourceDocument" href="https://solidproject.org/TR/2021/protocol-20211217">Solid Protocol</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-5">5</a>]</span>
as an LDP derivative with per-document access control,
has the benefit of being conceptually simple
and hence developer-friendly.
However, we argue in this article that the simplicity
afforded by a hierarchical document collection
stems from shortcuts taken by applications,
which are burrowing their own ad-hoc APIs with implicit semantics
into the container meta-model.
This hinders the Solid promise of data and application independence:
while the data itself contains explicit semantics that can be interpreted by apps,
the organization of that data is such that it its storage and retrieval
necessitates out-of-band contracts between different applications,
resulting in significant app-to-app coupling
and subsequently systematic app breakage when ad-hoc APIs eventually evolve.
Furthermore, we show that the abstraction easily breaks
when apps pursue slightly conflicting goals.</p>

        <p>These issues have so far largely gone unnoticed,
because singular apps do not hit such problems,
and different apps in a small ecosystem
can still coordinate behind the scenes.
However,
an emergence of more Solid apps that need to interoperate
has increased the frequency of such conflicts.
Stopgaps that are being created to address them
unfortunately only prolong unsustainable practices,
as many issues are simply inherent to the implicit semantics within ad-hoc APIs.
Proposals typically focus on making API semantics explicit <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-12">12</a>, <a href="#ref-13">13</a>]</span>,
yet they inevitably inherit the abstraction’s mismatches.
This is why we instead suggest pushing the vision forward
by separating the semantics from the API altogether.</p>

        <p>We observe that the document-centric interpretation
seems to act as a proxy for a more fundamental concept,
namely a permissioned, hybrid knowledge graph
that accommodates data as well as documents.
Our proposed graph-centric interpretation
put this concept at the heart of each pod,
and considers document interfaces such as those that exist today
as specialized views of an underlying richer source of truth.
This affords more flexibility—and hence independence—in
how multiple apps can interact with the same graph data.
Crucially,
this also broadens the solution space
to tackle interoperability challenges.
We are no longer confined to working around inherent LDP-level problems,
but can create solutions at the knowledge graph level
and mint associated API views tailored to the needs and constraints
of specific applications and use cases.
The same app can seamlessly interact
via different read and write interfaces to a pod,
depending on what it is optimizing for.
This also opens the door for authorization
with different granularities beyond the scope of
one specific LDP interface’s document organization.
We thereby shift the understanding
from a data graph instantiated from a document organization,
to a dynamically instantiated document interface over a data graph,
paving the way for fundamentally graph-centric data management within Solid.
Through the zoomed-out perspective of the pod
as a knowledge graph exposed over Web APIs, 
we refocus on the data itself
and reframe the interfaces as means to an end.</p>

        <p>Consequences from interpretation differences are not purely conceptual or theoretical.
For instance,
current implementations of alternative access APIs to pods
are still tainted by the document-centric interpretation.
A concrete consequence manifests itself
in the current <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsEvidence" href="https://docs.inrupt.com/ess/latest/query/qpf-endpoint/">Quad Pattern Fragments API</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-15">15</a>]</span>,
meant to facilitate complex queries over a pod.
This <em>quad-centric</em> API offers pattern-based access to RDF quads,
whose graph component is defined as
the URI where the <em>document-centric</em> API happens to expose them.
Ironically,
the server thereby imposes some of the same LDP constraints and mismatches
on the very API that is supposed to mitigate them.
This happens because the additional API is built on top of the LDP-based API,
which this interpretation considers to <em>be</em> the pod.
In a graph-centric interpretation,
the pod is instead a knowledge graph with multiple APIs as views.
Document URIs are ephemeral artifacts of one particular API
that carry no meaning in the graph,
nor in other views or apps.
Therefore,
a Quad Pattern Fragments API within the graph-centric interpretation
would never use the document URL from another API as fourth quad component.</p>

        <p>We stress that the document-centric as well as the graph-centric interpretation
are supported by the current Solid specifications,
notably the <a property="schema:citation http://purl.org/spar/cito/citesAsSourceDocument" href="https://solidproject.org/TR/2021/protocol-20211217">Solid Protocol</a> <span class="references">[<a href="#ref-5">5</a>]</span>,
which is a testament to both the orthogonality of the specification
and the vision compatibility of graph-centricity.
Specifically,
the graph-centric interpretation of the Solid vision
still embraces document-based access as a core building block for APIs.
What changes is the role played by the document hierarchy:
rather than the one absolute source of truth of a pod,
we recognize more value in seeing it as one of many views
into a much more elaborate knowledge graph,
for which APIs act as a vessel.
Therefore,
what is in a pod is essentially in the eye of the beholder:
all depends on which view offers the best fit for a specific purpose.</p>
