## Abstract 
<!-- Context      -->
The Solid ecosystem provides specifications
for the publication and consumption of decentralized permissioned data,
stored across multiple locations called <q>Pods</q>.
<!-- Need         -->
A disconnect exists between the practical notion of a Pod
and the protocol that provides access to its data,
creating confusion as to what exactly a Pod is
and how it relates to the technical specifications.
To reinstate clarity,
<!-- Task         -->
we examined possible interpretations of the technological underpinnings,
and compared them from the viewpoints of
storage, publication and query.
<!-- Object       -->
First, this article details
the current understanding of Pods as
a hierarchical collection of Linked Data documents.
Second,
we propose a wider definition
in which a Solid Pod is fundamentally a knowledge graph,
which can be accessed through various Web APIs
that act as views in a database sense.
<!-- Findings     -->
We argue that the latter zoomed-out perspective
enables accessing and querying knowledge within Pods
in more flexible and sustainable ways.
<!-- Conclusion   -->
These insights are crucial to reduce
the dependency of Solid apps on concrete APIs
and local assumptions about the shape and organization of data
and the resulting performance.
<!-- Perspectives -->
The suggested broader perspective supports Solid with
evolving into a heterogeneous but interoperable ecosystem
that accommodates for a multitude of data access patterns.
