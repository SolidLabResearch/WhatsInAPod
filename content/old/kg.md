## Solid as a knowledge graph.
{:#kg}
In this section, we take a step back and argue that a "data pod" on the Web can be envisioned as a knowledge graph exposed over the Web over a specific interface.
With this perspective, we can view the currently proposed Solid protocol as a Linked Data Platform interface over the knowledge graph of all data in the pod where all data is stored as 


It is defined by the solidproject website as "a specification that lets people store their data securely in decentralized data stores called Pods. Pods are like secure personal web servers for your data." Further specifying that any kind of information can be stored in a Solid pod, it enables control of access to the data in your pod, control over what data you share with whom, and the revoking of access, and the use of standard open and interoperable data formats and protocols.
These definitions put Solid as a set of Specifications that should enable the defined functionality.
