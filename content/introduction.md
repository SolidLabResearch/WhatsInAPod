## Introduction
The current Web has come a long way from it's initial vision.
Originally designed as a decentralized network of computers serving and retrieving data form and to the network, 
data has become more centralized as large companies took over larger portions of the Web with services spanning billions of accounts.

As a response to this, the Solid project was introduced by sir. Tim Berners Lee, the inventor of the original Web[TODO:: a lot]().

Solid was introduced to the world as a platform that enables a decentralized Web of personal online datastores(PODs) [TODO:: cite]().
Solid is a technology for organizing data, applications, and identities on the web by building on existing web standards [cite:inrupt.com/solid/]().
It tries to provide data independence and simple yet powerful data management mechanisms.

Over time, as the specifications for the original vision of the project evolved.
We notice that the dependency on the used Linked Data Platform interface,
over which data interactions are made possible, 
define the possibilities of the platform.



- Solid project was initialized as a Platform for decentralize data pods on the Web for Social Linked Data applications.
- During its lifetime, the Solid specifications have undergone changes
- The current understanding of Solid has been evolving with these changes
- Need to align with the original vision
