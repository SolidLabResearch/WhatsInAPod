## Conclusion # {#conclusion}

In this work, we proposed the perspective of viewing the Solid pod as a permissioned Knowledge Graph. 
While this perspective does not in itself solve the existing issues with longevity of application interoperability in the Solid ecosystem, it provides a framework that can be used to tackle the present challenges in a way that is more dependent on the data and less dependent on the interfaces used to expose the data over the Web

Where the current state of Solid as a datastore organized according to its Linked Data Platform interface limits the innovation surface through applications creating localized assumptions, 

We believe this perspective provides the required framing for Solid to fully take the next step from being an ecosystem still centered around API integration through localized assumptions creating application specific interfaces through data organization over LDP, towards an ecosystem centered around data integration over well-defined interfaces  [TODO:: this and more]().


With this work, we do not propose any specific takeaway as to which interfaces may optimize the current problems of data shape and organization when building applications on top of Solid, but want to provide a framework with which these problems can be tackled in a way that is not restricted to only what the LDP interface allows.

<!-- -------------------

The insights proposed in this work are crucial to eliminate 
the dependency of Solid apps on concrete APIs.
Local assumptions about the shape and organization of data creating localized APIs for applications over the Linked Data Platform interface exposed by Solid data pods provide local optimizations for data discovery, querying performance and more, but hurt the ecosystem as a whole, as assumptions and biases in the organization and discovery of data are not shared across the ecosystem.

The framing of Solid pods as a Knowledge Graph exposed over a multitude of APIs contrary to a data source organized using the Linked Data Platform specification enables us to think more about 
with the goal of reducing local assumptions and optimizations in apps for reasons of longevity. The API over which data is exposed over the Web is a means to an end, and should not define the platform. -->
