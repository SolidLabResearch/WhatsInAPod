## Conclusion # {#conclusion}
The insights proposed in this work are crucial to eliminate 
the dependency of Solid apps on concrete APIs.
Local assumptions about the shape and organization of data creating localized APIs for applications over the Linked Data Platform interface exposed by Solid data pods provide local optimizations for data discovery, querying performance and more, but hurt the ecosystem as a whole, as assumptions and biases in the organization and discovery of data are not shared across the ecosystem.

The framing of Solid pods as a Knowledge Graph exposed over a multitude of APIs contrary to a data source organized using the Linked Data Platform specification enables us to think more about 
with the goal of reducing local assumptions and optimizations in apps for reasons of longevity. The API over which data is exposed over the Web is a means to an end, and should not define the platform.

With this work, we do not propose any specific takeaway as to which interfaces may optimize the current problems of data shape and organization when building applications on top of Solid, but want to provide a framework with which these problems can be tackled in a way that is not restricted to only what the LDP interface allows.
