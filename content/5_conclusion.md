## Conclusion # {#conclusion}
<!-- <span class="todo">Emphasize that the existing Solid Protocol (LDP+WAC) remains untouched! That both the existing and proposed interpretation are implemented with the same spec. What changes is below the boundary of the spec, namely the role the spec (LDP) plays on the server.</span> -->

<!-- Reflection on the current ecosystem -->
In the current Solid ecosystem,
the common interpretation of the ecosystem has moved towards a document-centric vision,
where the Linked Data Platform interface is central to the notion of what constitutes a Solid pod.
It creates a limited space for innovation,
by constraining the interoperability and user control of data
to the document hierarchy on the Solid pod.

<!-- With this work, we propose perspective of Solid as ...  -->
With this work, we proposed the interpretation of the Solid pod 
being fundamentally a permissioned, hybrid knowledge graph, 
exposed through Web APIs. 

<!-- what does it do -->
Through this zoomed-out perspective of the ecosystem
we define an innovation space that is not constrained 
by specific protocols, but that can build upon the current 
protocols to provide more general solutions for the 
challenges faced by the ecosystem.

<!-- how does it build -->
By reframing the current protocols for managing data (LDP) 
and authorization (WAC/ACP) into interfaces exposing an 
internal knowledge graph of the Solid pod,
we can re-use these protocols in a new setting.
By shifting the understanding from a data graph 
created over a document system,
towards a document system,
dynamically created over a data graph,
we can fundamentally shift the understanding of the ecosystem
towards a graph-centric interpretation.

Though we do not propose any specific takeaway as to which interfaces 
may be better suited to provide solutions in the current ecosystem,
we invite the reader to think along in how this zoomed-out perspective of the ecosystem
can lead to better solutions to the problems faced by the ecosystem today.

What's in a pod? *It's in the eye of the beholder*, not in the constraints of the interface.
