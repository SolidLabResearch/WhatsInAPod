## Introduction # {#introduction}
The current Web has come a long way from it's initial vision.
Originally designed as a decentralized network of computers serving and retrieving data form and to the network, 
data has become more centralized as large companies took over larger portions of the Web with services spanning billions of accounts.

As a response to this, the Solid project was introduced by sir. Tim Berners Lee, the inventor of the original Web[TODO:: a lot]().

Solid was introduced to the world as a platform that enables a decentralized Web of personal online datastores(PODs) 
by building on existing web standards [TODO:: cite]().

Over time, as the specifications for the original vision of the project evolved,
The dependency on the Linked Data Platform specification, 
originally proposed as the read/write interface for Solid, 
has had the consequence of defining the platform as a Linked Data Platform API that enables the interaction with data.

In this work, we propose that a Solid data pod should not be viewed as an API but as a Knowledge graph
that can be interacted with over a multitude of API's.
The interface used to manage and expose the data over the Web should be viewed as a means to an end
as opposed to being the central focus of the data platform.

In [](#problem_statement), we define the problem with viewing a data pod a an LDP API.
With [](#vision), we propose the merit of defining a data pod as a knowledge graph that can be exposed over a multitude of APIs.
[](#comparison) includes a high-level comparison over the interpretations of a data pod, after which a conclusion is formulated in [](#conclusion).






<!-- 
- Solid project was initialized as a Platform for decentralize data pods on the Web for Social Linked Data applications.
- During its lifetime, the Solid specifications have undergone changes
- The current understanding of Solid has been evolving with these changes
- Need to align with the original vision
