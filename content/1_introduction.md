## Introduction # {#introduction}
The current Web has come a long way from it's initial vision.
Originally designed as a decentralized network of computers serving and retrieving data form and to the network, 
data has become more centralized as data traffic converged to centralized platforms that span billions of accounts.

As a response to this, the Solid project was introduced by sir. Tim Berners Lee, the inventor of the original Web[TODO:: this is a weak intro]().
Solid was presented as a data platform enabling a decentralized Web of personal online datastores(PODs)
by building on existing web standards [TODO:: cite]().
The Linked Data Platform specification was chosen as a way to organize data on a data pod.
[TODO:: write some good flavour text above. Maybe yoink some from other papers]()

We see that in the current state, the specification has started to define the platform, where the use of Linked Data Platform to organize data on a data pod leads to local assumptions being made in applications on how data organization in a data pod should be handled.

In this work, we propose the vision of Solid as a platform of data pods containing an internal Knowledge Graph that can expose this knowledge graph over a multitude of interfaces.

In [](#problem_statement), we define the problem with viewing a data pod as a Linked Data Platform API, and how this leads to biases of the interface being transferred to the data stored.
With [](#vision), we propose the merit of defining a data pod as a knowledge graph that can be exposed over a multitude of APIs.
[](#comparison) includes a high-level comparison over the interpretations of a data pod, after which a conclusion is formulated in [](#conclusion).
