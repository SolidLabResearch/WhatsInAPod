  abstract = {This paper presents Solid, a decentralized platform for social Web applications. In Solid, users’ data is managed independently of the applications that create and consume this data. The user’s data is stored in a Web-accessible personal online datastore (or pod). Solid allows users to have one or more pods from diﬀerent pod providers, while at the same time enabling users to easily switch between providers. Developers can use Solid protocols, which is based on existing W3C recommendations, for reading, writing and access control of the contents of users’ pods. In Solid architecture, applications can operate over data owned by the user or the user has access to regardless the location of this data on the Web. Users can also control access to their data, and have the option to switch between applications at any time. This is paradigm shift in integrating social features into Web applications. Our new paradigm produces a novel line of social applications. We have used Semantic Web technologies to build Solid prototypes, allowing us to demonstrate its utility through a set of applications for common day-to-day tasks. We also conduct experiments to show the scalability of the Solid prototypes.},

For example, even though LDP 1.0 contains nothing specific to ”social”, many of the Social Web Working Group User Stories6 can be implemented in Solid, using only LDP and application logic, with no need to change code on the server.}

Each user stores their data in a Web-accessible personal online datastore (or pod). Each user can have one or more pods from different pod providers, and can easily switch between providers. Applications access data in users' pods using well defined protocols, and a decentralized authentication and access control mechanism guarantees the privacy of the data. In this decentralized architecture, applications can operate on users' data wherever it is stored. Users control access to their data, and have the option to switch between applications at any time. We will demonstrate the utility of Solid and how it is experienced from the point of view of end users and application developers. For this, we will use a set of Solid servers and multiple Web applications that use these servers. We believe that experience with a concrete platform such as Solid is highly valuable in truly appreciating the power of a decentralized social Web.},

  abstract  = {Most of today's web applications are tightly coupled to proprietary server backends that store and control all user data. This thesis presents Linked Data as a decentralized web app platform, eliminating vendor lock-in, and separating user data from web apps giving users control over their data and where it's stored, independent of choice of application. Linked Data architecture replaces traditional app-data silos with a universal integration platform using global identifiers, shared ontologies, and a scalable, standardized data model. We provide 3 interoperable Linked Data server implementations in PHP, Python, and Go, and evaluate their performance. Traditional filesystems and relational databases have been integrated, and several new decentralized web apps have been developed for the platform. As of May 2014, worldwide open source community members are using and contributing to these compatible apps and servers, and the design continues to be refined and standardized at the W3C.

  abstractnote = {Query evaluation over Linked Data sources has become a complex story, given the multitude of algorithms and techniques for single- and multi-source querying, as well as the heterogeneity of Web interfaces through which data is published online. Today’s query processors are insufficiently adaptable to test multiple query engine aspects in combination, such as evaluating the performance of a certain join algorithm over a federation of heterogeneous interfaces. The Semantic Web research community is in need of a flexible query engine that allows plugging in new components such as different algorithms, new or experimental SPARQL features, and support for new Web interfaces. We designed and developed a Web-friendly and modular meta query engine called that meets these specifications. In this article, we introduce this query engine and explain the architectural choices behind its design. We show how its modular nature makes it an ideal research platform for investigating new kinds of Linked Data interfaces and querying algorithms. Comunica facilitates the development, testing, and evaluation of new query processing capabilities, both in isolation and in combination with others.},
