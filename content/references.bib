  abstract  = {Solid is a decentralized platform for social Web applications. In the Solid platform, users' data is managed independently of the applications that create and consume this data. Each user stores their data in a Web-accessible personal online datastore (or pod). Each user can have one or more pods from different pod providers, and can easily switch between providers. Applications access data in users' pods using well defined protocols, and a decentralized authentication and access control mechanism guarantees the privacy of the data. In this decentralized architecture, applications can operate on users' data wherever it is stored. Users control access to their data, and have the option to switch between applications at any time. We will demonstrate the utility of Solid and how it is experienced from the point of view of end users and application developers. For this, we will use a set of Solid servers and multiple Web applications that use these servers. We believe that experience with a concrete platform such as Solid is highly valuable in truly appreciating the power of a decentralized social Web.},

  abstractnote = {Query evaluation over Linked Data sources has become a complex story, given the multitude of algorithms and techniques for single- and multi-source querying, as well as the heterogeneity of Web interfaces through which data is published online. Today’s query processors are insufficiently adaptable to test multiple query engine aspects in combination, such as evaluating the performance of a certain join algorithm over a federation of heterogeneous interfaces. The Semantic Web research community is in need of a flexible query engine that allows plugging in new components such as different algorithms, new or experimental SPARQL features, and support for new Web interfaces. We designed and developed a Web-friendly and modular meta query engine called that meets these specifications. In this article, we introduce this query engine and explain the architectural choices behind its design. We show how its modular nature makes it an ideal research platform for investigating new kinds of Linked Data interfaces and querying algorithms. Comunica facilitates the development, testing, and evaluation of new query processing capabilities, both in isolation and in combination with others.},

abstract="Constructing a knowledge graph with mapping languages, such as RML or SPARQL-Generate, allows seamlessly integrating heterogeneous data by defining access-specific definitions for e.g., databases or files. However, such mapping languages have limited support for describing Web APIs and no support for describing data with varying velocities, as needed for e.g., streams, neither for the input data nor for the output RDF. This hampers the smooth and reproducible generation of knowledge graphs from heterogeneous data and their continuous integration for consumption since each implementation provides its own extensions. Recently, the Web of Things (WoT) Working Group released a set of recommendations to provide a machine-readable description of metadata and network-facing interfaces for Web APIs and streams. In this paper, we investigated (i)Â how mapping languages can be aligned with the newly specified recommendations to describe and handle heterogeneous data with varying velocities and Web APIs, and (ii)Â how such descriptions can be used to indicate how the generated knowledge graph should be exported. We extended RML's Logical Source to support WoT descriptions of Web APIs and streams, and introduced RML's Logical Target to describe the generated knowledge graph reusing the same descriptions. We implemented these extensions in the RMLMapper and RMLStreamer, and validated our approach in two use cases. Mapping languages are now able to use the same descriptions to define the input data but also the output RDF. This way, our work paves the way towards more reproducible workflows for knowledge graph generation.",
